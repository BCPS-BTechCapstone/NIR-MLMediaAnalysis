  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} The world's top three cereals, based on their monetary value, are rice, wheat, and corn. In cereal crops, DNA extraction is difficult owing to rigid non-cellulose components in the cell wall of leaves and high starch and protein content in grains. The advanced techniques in molecular biology require pure and quick extraction of DNA. The majority of existing DNA extraction methods rely on long incubation and multiple precipitations or commercially available kits to produce contaminant-free high molecular weight DNA. Results:{\enspace} In this study, we compared three different methods used for the isolation of high-quality genomic DNA from the grains of cereal crop, Zea mays, with minor modifications. The DNA from the grains of two maize hybrids, M10 and M321, was extracted using extraction methods DNeasy Qiagen Plant Mini Kit, CTAB-method (with/without 1\% PVP) and modified Mericon extraction. Genes coding for 45S ribosomal RNA are organized in tandem arrays of up to several thousand copies and contain codes for 18S, 5.8S and 26S rRNA units separated by internal transcribed spac-ers ITS1 and ITS2. While the rRNA units are evolutionary conserved, ITS regions show high level of interspecific diver-gence and have been used frequently in genetic diversity and phylogenetic studies. In this study, the genomic DNA was then amplified with PCR using primers specific for ITS gene. PCR products were then visualized on agarose gel. Conclusion:{\enspace} The modified Mericon extraction method was found to be the most efficient DNA extraction method, capable to provide high DNA yields with better quality, affordable cost and less time.},

  abstract = {G-quadruplexes are four-stranded nucleic acid complexes that exhibit a great deal of polymorphism. Recently a group described the polymorphism exhibited by the four-repeat of the Oxytricha nova telomeric sequences (Lee, J.Y., Yoon, J., Kihm, H.W., Kim, D.S., Biochemistry 2008, 47, 3389--3396). In this study we evaluated the effects of G-tract and loop lengths on this behaviour using circular dichroism (CD) and gel electrophoresis. The largest changes were detected for oligonucleotides with different numbers of consecutive G residues. Furthermore, decreasing the number of residues between the G runs, the loops, from four to three only results in minor alteration in the polymorphism. However, the shortening of the G-tract from four to three guanine residues led to characteristically anti-parallel G-quadruplex CD spectra. Finally, we show that adenine bases in the loop sequences are less likely to form G-quadruplexes in the presence of Na+ cations than those comprised of thymine residues. The results presented here are an addition to the modest information available for predicting the type of G-quadruplex to be formed from G-rich sequences in aqueous solutions containing sodium or potassium ions.},

  abstract = {Bioleaching is a promising technology for recovering base metals and concentrating precious elements in secondary resources. In this study, the extraction of base metals from printed circuit boards (PCBs) was optimized using a dual control system including biomass encapsulation. Gold recovery was achieved in a second step by chemical dissolution followed by biosorption on brewer's yeast. A dual regulation system, controlling oxidoreduction potential (ORP) and copper concentration, was established. This system comprised two reactors interconnected in a loop: a leaching reactor and a biological reactor. Acidophilic bacteria in the biological reactor recycled ferrous into ferric iron in a low shear stress environment. The Fe3+ solution from the biological reactor recirculated to the leaching compartment (hosting the PCBs) based on ORP regulation (optimal setpoint: +410\,mV vs Ag/AgCl). A second control aimed to maintain the copper concentration below the inhibitory level (15\,g Cu2+ L-1) by addition of fresh medium and overflow of leachate. This configuration ensured the highest pulp density, operating consistently, in steady state, at the inhibitory concentration limit, the PCBs being added batch-wise when the stock within the leaching compartment was exhausted. Compared to planktonic cells, the encapsulated mode showed optimal base metals leaching yields: 100\% for Cu, 24\% for Al, 49\% for Ni, and 100\% for Zn, with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 92\,h and an iron oxidation rate of 0.455\,mg\,L-1\,h-1. The reactor's productivity was 5.91\,g Cu L-1d-1, corresponding to the leaching of 20.88\,g PCBs L-1d-1. The gold enriched PCBs (from 290 to 450\,mg Au kg-1) were then extracted using Aqua regia, with a 24:1 liquid/solid ratio at 80\,{$^\circ$}C for 2\,h. Subsequent biosorption on brewer's yeast (10\,g yeast L-1) selectively recovered gold, with 98\% efficiency. Biosorption yields for ``fresh'' yeast resulting from a model brewing (90.8\%) and commercial ``active dry'' yeast (88.7\%) were comparable, indicating the potential use of spent yeast from brewing.},

Despite advances in medical technology and laboratory automation, red cell morphology remains a basic aspect of haematological evaluation. The human erythrocytes are discoid (bi-concave), about 7--8~{$\mu$}m (size of the nucleus of a small lymphocyte) in diameter, with a central area of pallor (which occupies a third of the red cell diameter) and is well haemoglobinised in the outer two thirds of the red cell diameters, without any inclusions. Deviations from the normal in terms of size, shape, colour, distribution or presence of inclusion bodies suggests possible disease processes. This chapter is therefore dedicated to morphologic description of the human erythrocytes, a study of possible abnormalities, its underlying pathophysiology and the associated differential diagnosis in humans.},

An enterohemorrhagic bacterial strain, E. coli O157: H7 infects the alimentary tract and induces abdominal cramps with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Transmission of E. coli O157: H7 occurs via the fecal-oral route after consumption of contaminated, undercooked liquids and foods. Alternatively, E. coli 0157: H7 can be transmitted by person-to-person through fecal shedding and accounts for an estimated 11\% of infections. The production of Shiga toxins is a key factor contributing to the development of HUS. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157: H7 induces illness secondary to its production of Shiga toxin that causes a range of gastrointestinal illnesses, from watery diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis. E. coli 0157: H7 induces enterohemorrhagic disease that can cause systemic illness by hemolytic uremic syndrome, which manifests as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS can result in both acute, potentially life-threatening illness and lifelong, chronic illness.[2]},

  abstract = {The effect of sample movement on spectral response during fiber probe diffuse reflectance near-infrared spectrometry (NIR) sampling was characterized. This is of central importance in Process Analytical Chemistry (PAC) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT). The incitement to this study was the observation of spectral artifacts during measurements of powder samples in process streams when using a mechanically scanning spectrometer. Artifacts appeared as momentary changes in the spectral response during acquisition of a scan. These transitions emanate from continuous replacement of the sample subfraction seen by the probe and are typical for turbid media where sample properties may vary locally with respect to scattering and/or absorption. The impact on qualitative and quantitative analysis using chemometric methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression was evaluated through experimental and theoretical simulations. It was generally found that spectra with the smallest residuals after projection onto the models came from non-moving samples or samples moving only slowly. It is shown that the magnitude of the spectral residuals is directly connected to the effective sample size, which relates both to sample speed as well as to the sample area presented to the probe. Implications for in-line/on-line process analysis of solids are discussed.},

  abstract = {We developed a DNA microarray that contains random genomic DNA fragments of Listeria monocytogenes, validated its diagnostic abilities using cells grown in laboratory media and milk, and established enrichment conditions for detection of a low population of L. monocytogenes in milk. Genomic DNA of L. monocytogenes strain ATCC 19111 was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis after being cleaved using several different pairs of restriction enzymes. Sixty DNA fragments of different sizes were randomly selected and spotted onto an amine-coated glass slide. To validate diagnostic ability, probes on the DNA microarray were hybridized with genomic DNA extracted from L. monocytogenes, other Listeria spp., and foodborne pathogenic bacteria belonging to other genera grown in laboratory media. The DNA microarray showed 98--100\% positive hybridization signals for the 16 strains of L. monocytogenes tested, 7--85\% positive signals for 9 strains of other Listeria spp., and 0--32\% positive signals for 13 strains of other types of foodborne pathogens. In milk, the detection limit of the DNA microarray was approximately 8 log CFU/mL. When milk contained L. monocytogenes (3--4 log CFU/mL) with other types of bacteria (Bacillus spp., B. cereus, Salmonella Montevideo, Peudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia enterocolitica; ca. 3 log CFU/mL each), L. monocytogenes enriched in UVM modified Listeria enrichment broth at 37{$^\circ$}C for 24h was successfully detected by the DNA microarray. Results indicate that the DNA microarray can detect L. monocytogenes and distinguish it from other Listeria spp. and other foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and milk.

Their heat-resistance, the sugar concentration limiting their germination and growth in berry-based media, and a possible relation between the contamination levels of the raw materials used and the spoilage incidence in strawberry jams were assessed. Heat resistance data obtained from thermal death curves showed that the D values of the strains tested ranged between 3.7 and 13.5 min at 87 {$^\circ$}C; 1.5 and 3.5 min at 90 {$^\circ$}C; and 0.3 and 0.4 min at 95 {$^\circ$}C in glucose solution. Similarly, D values ranged between 3.3 and 15.4 min at 87 {$^\circ$}C; 1.3 and 4.3 min at 90 {$^\circ$}C; and 0.3 and 0.6 min at 95 {$^\circ$}C in strawberry-based formulation. For all strains, the corresponding z-values ranged between 5.7 and 8.3 {$^\circ$}C in glucose solution and from 5.7 to 8.4 {$^\circ$}C in strawberry formulation. With regard to the limitation of fungal germination and growth in fruit-based media, sucrose concentrations required to avoid growth varied between 45.0 and 55.0\% for strawberry medium and between 42.5\% and 50.0\% for blueberry medium. Spore inactivation was observed below aw 0.88--0.91 for strawberries and aw 0.87--0.90 for blueberries; above 49.7--56.5 {$^\circ$}Bx for strawberries and 49.6--56.0 {$^\circ$}Bx for blueberries. The threshold optical refractometric residue proved strain-dependent, but substrate-independent, as for each strain the highest Brix degree value at which germination occurred was the same on both media, despite their different sucrose concentrations. With regard to the relation between contamination of raw materials by heat-resistant mould spores and spoilage incidence on final product, an equation was modelled to estimate the occurrence of fungal spoilage in strawberry jams for low contamination levels (26--46 CFU/kg). Although it could not be used as a definitive tool to predict final spoilage in such of products, it could give important practical information to jam producers in preventing spoilage of their products.},

Although it could not be used as a definitive tool to predict final spoilage in such of products, it could give important practical information to jam producers in preventing spoilage of their products.},

The results showed sharp increase in conductance with increase in concentration of sodium dodecylsulfate. Also, the conductance increases with addition of salts. The conductance of sodium dodecylsulfate is found more in the presence of Na2SO4 than ZnSO4 in aqueous media. In the presence of salts, the critical micelle concentration (cmc) value decreases which are explained on the basis of the nature and ion size of the added ion. The graph of conductance versus concentration is used in determining the critical micelle concentration (cmc).}

Lastly, while the vast majority of drugs undergo elimination via first-order kinetics, a firm understanding of both zero and first-order kinetics is crucial in a clinical setting, as there can be fluidity between~the two types of elimination with the same specific substance.},

  abstract = {The use of buffers that mimic biological solutions is a foundation of biochemical and biophysical studies. However, buffering agents have both specific and nonspecific interactions with proteins. Buffer molecules can induce changes in conformational equilibria, dynamic behavior, and catalytic properties merely by their presence in solution. This effect is of concern because many of the standard experiments used to investigate protein structure and function involve changing solution conditions such as pH and/or temperature. In experiments in which pH is varied, it is common practice to switch buffering agents so that the pH is within the working range of the weak acid and conjugate base. If multiple buffers are used, it is not always possible to decouple buffer induced change from pH or temperature induced change. We have developed a series of mixed biological buffers for protein analysis that can be used across a broad pH range, are compatible with biologically relevant metal ions, and avoid complications that may arise from changing the small molecule composition of buffers when pH is used as an experimental variable.},

It has been widely adopted by governments and companies across the OECD membership and beyond and is currently most commonly used for electronics, packaging, vehicles, and tyres. The success of EPR in increasing material recovery rates has triggered a debate about expanding the use of EPR to additional product groups. Additionally, there is a debate about expanding producer responsibilities to additional impact categories, which go beyond the traditional use of EPR to cover end-of-life costs that occur at the domestic level. This paper presents a discussion of relatively novel applications of EPR to additional product groups (plastic products beyond packaging, textiles, construction materials, and food waste) and to environmental impacts (design considerations, pollution and littering) that occur throughout the product lifecycle. Based on select case studies, this report evaluates the successes and challenges that early adopters of applying the EPR approach to new product groups or additional environmental impact categories have experienced. It reviews the arguments for further application of EPR, possible limitations and provides guidance on when and how to best apply an EPR.},

  abstract = {The fabrication of 3D scaffolds is under wide investigation in tissue engineering (TE) because of its incessant development of new advanced technologies and the improvement of traditional processes. Currently, scientific and clinical research focuses on scaffold characterization to restore the function of missing or damaged tissues. A key for suitable scaffold production is the guarantee of an interconnected porous structure that allows the cells to grow as in native tissue. The fabrication techniques should meet the appropriate requirements, including feasible reproducibility and time- and cost-effective assets. This is necessary for easy processability, which is associated with the large range of biomaterials supporting the use of fabrication technologies. This paper presents a review of scaffold fabrication methods starting from polymer solutions that provide highly porous structures under controlled process parameters. In this review, general information of solution-based technologies, including freeze-drying, thermally or diffusion induced phase separation (TIPS or DIPS), and electrospinning, are presented, along with an overview of their technological strategies and applications. Furthermore, the differences in the fabricated constructs in terms of pore size and distribution, porosity, morphology, and mechanical and biological properties, are clarified and critically reviewed. Then, the combination of these techniques for obtaining scaffolds is described, offering the advantages of mimicking the unique architecture of tissues and organs that are intrinsically difficult to design.},

It is classified separately from other forms of heat illness as the latter require assessment of mental function for differential diagnosis. This is not possible with MH which occurs during general anesthesia when mental function cannot be assessed. MH occurs in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to inhalation anesthetics or succinylcholine. The genetic defects identified so far cause perturbation of skeletal muscle excitation--contraction coupling resulting in myoplasmic calcium dysregulation. The most commonly involved gene is RYR1. Increased myoplasmic calcium leads to hypermetabolism and sustained muscle contractile activity with consequent increased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, sympathetic stimulation, muscle rigidity, heat production, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Untreated reactions are fatal. In this chapter we summarize clinical features and management and review current understanding of the pathophysiology and molecular genetics of MH},

Microarrays developed as a technique for large-scale DNA mapping and sequencing. However, changing the support surface from a porous membrane to a solid surface afforded significant improvements by increasing reaction kinetics and reducing background noise. The technology for DNA microarrays continues to evolve. The commonly used arrays are divided into two main categories that include oligonucleotide and spotted or complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays. Commercial oligonucleotide platforms have gained popularity over homemade, spotted cDNA microarrays as costs have fallen to the point where commercial microarrays are the de facto platform. DNA microarrays provide a panoramic and quantitative overview of a sample's expression output. The power is immense as biological processes generally result from the coordinated interaction of multiple genes.},

The obtained scaffolds were characterized concerning their morphology, composition and mechanical properties. It was shown that the compressive properties of scaffolds depended on their composition and inter-layer angle. The ultimate compressive strength of composite scaffolds containing 70\,wt\% hydroxyapatite reached 14.3\,MPa after optimization. The 3D printed composite scaffolds resulted in comparable mechanical properties with cancellous bone, which could extend their potential application in bone repair and regeneration.},

  abstract = {Detecting foodborne pathogens as quickly and reliably as possible is a matter of public safety. In the last two decades, the field of food microbiology has evolved with increasing speed, also thanks to genome sequences available for many of the pathogens involved. In this chapter, conventional methods, analytical techniques, and recent developments in food pathogen array-based detection, identification, and quantification are described. We report the main applications involving the use of DNA microarrays as detection tools. The chapter, initially, focuses on the most recent developments and experimental results of more traditional array technologies, then new biomolecular techniques, such as integrated platforms for the miniaturized detection of pathogens, are discussed with the description of some interesting approaches and innovative applications. A final paragraph, dedicated to the latest developments and trends in the ``omics'' field, suggests new opportunities to solve old food safety problems.},

  abstract = {Background Many medicines are dosed to achieve a particular therapeutic range, and monitored using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The evidence base for a therapeutic range can be evaluated using systematic reviews, to ensure it continues to reflect current indications, doses, routes and formulations, as well as updated adverse effect data. There is no consensus on the optimal methodology for systematic reviews of therapeutic ranges. Methods An overview of systematic reviews of therapeutic ranges was undertaken. The following databases were used: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects (DARE) and MEDLINE. The published methodologies used when systematically reviewing the therapeutic range of a drug were analyzed. Step by step recommendations to optimize such systematic reviews are proposed. Results Ten systematic reviews that investigated the correlation between serum concentrations and clinical outcomes encompassing a variety of medicines and indications were assessed. There were significant variations in the methodologies used (including the search terms used, data extraction methods, assessment of bias, and statistical analyses undertaken). Therapeutic ranges should be population and indication specific and based on clinically relevant outcomes. Recommendations for future systematic reviews based on these findings have been developed. Conclusion Evidence based therapeutic ranges have the potential to improve TDM practice. Current systematic reviews investigating therapeutic ranges have highly variable methodologies and there is no consensus of best practice when undertaking systematic reviews in this field. These recommendations meet a need not addressed by standard protocols.},

  abstract = {A systematic characterisation of bone tissue scaffolds fabricated via 3D printing from hydroxyapatite (HA) and poly(vinyl)alcohol (PVOH) composite powders is presented. Flowability of HA:PVOH precursor materials was observed to affect mechanical stability, microstructure and porosity of 3D printed scaffolds. Anisotropic behaviour of constructs and part failure at the boundaries of interlayer bonds was highlighted by compressive strength testing. A trade-off between the ability to facilitate removal of PVOH thermal degradation products during sintering and the compressive strength of green parts was revealed. The ultimate compressive strength of 55\% porous green scaffolds printed along the Y-axis and dried in a vacuum oven for 6h was 0.88{\textpm}0.02MPa. Critically, the pores of 3D printed constructs could be user designed, ensuring bulk interconnectivity, and the imperfect packing of powder particles created an inherent surface roughness and non-designed porosity within the scaffold. These features are considered promising since they are known to facilitate osteoconduction and osteointegration in-vivo. Characterisation techniques utilised in this study include two funnel flow tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), compressive strength testing and computed tomography (CT).},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Rectal cancer (RC) accounts for one-third of colorectal cancers (CRC), and 40\% of these are locally advanced rectal cancers (LARC). The use of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) significantly reduces the rate of local recurrence compared to adjuvant therapy or surgery alone. However, after nCRT, up to 40\%-60\% of patients show a poor pathological response, while only about 20\% achieve a pathological complete response. In this scenario, the identification of novel predictors of tumor response to nCRT is urgently needed to reduce LARC mortality and to spare poorly responding patients from unnecessary treatments. Therefore, by combining gene and microRNA expression datasets with proteomic data from LARC patients, we developed an integrated network centered on seven hub-genes putatively involved in the response to nCRT. In an independent validation cohort of LARC patients, we confirmed that differential expression of               NFKB1               ,               TRAF6               and               STAT3               is correlated with the response to nCRT. In addition, the functional enrichment analysis also revealed that these genes are strongly related to hallmarks of cancer and inflammation, whose dysfunction may causatively affect LARC patient's response to nCRT. Furthermore, by constructing the transcription factor-module network, we hypothesized a protective role of               POU2F3               gene, which could be used as a new drug target in LARC patients. Finally, we identified and tested in vitro entinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, as a chemical compound that could be combined with a classical therapeutic regimen in order to design more efficient therapeutic strategies in LARC management.},

Unlike unstructured models, flux balance analysis-based models investigate the genome-scale network reconstructions of the microorganisms under study. Although these models are accurate, they pose computational cost challenges in rigorous optimization tasks or online optimal control strategies. In this work, we develop low-computational cost hybrid models by using deep convolutional neural networks to surrogate the problem/model. Furthermore, to address the computational challenges associated with optimal control of flux balance analysis-based models, we propose a successive linearization scheme that incorporates a Laguerre function-based model predictive control strategy coupled with a Luenberger-like observer. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, optimal control of a fed-batch process is considered. Results show the acceptable accuracy of the proposed hybrid model and control scheme while reducing the computational cost significantly.},

This study focuses on evaluating the PathogenDx microarray-based system to detect Salmonella in ground beef and verify critical parameters that could interfere with the method's effectiveness, such as enrichment incubation time, ground beef fat content, inclusivity, exclusivity, and analytical sensitivity. Sample preparation protocols were evaluated at 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24\,h enrichment times at varying bacterial levels to identify optimal conditions to detect the invA gene using the PathogenDx microarray. An 8\,h enrichment step was selected based on 100\% detection when initial inoculum levels were {$\geq$}5\,CFU/g, and fractional detection was achieved when the concentration was as low as 1\,CFU/g. Thus, the detection of Salmonella using the PathogenDx microarray system can be conducted in 12.5\,h, including sample preparation, labeling PCR, hybridization, and analysis. Regarding fat content, there was no significant difference in detection rates of PathogenDx protocol among the highest and lowest commercially sold lean-to-fat ratios of ground beef. Inclusivity and exclusivity experiments showed that Salmonella was correctly identified 100\% of the time. Using the ground beef matrix, PathogenDx method is comparable to the United States Department of Agriculture's Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook methodology for detection, which correctly identified Salmonella in 100\% of the samples. Salmonella was detected between 93.33 and 100\% when ground beef was inoculated with 1 and 5\,CFU/g, respectively.},

The problem is particularly critical in the field of FTIR spectroscopy where numerous new methods are becoming available on the market. The present papers reports the construction of a protein library (cSP92) including commercially available products, that are well characterized experimentally for their purity and solubility in conditions compatible with the recording of FTIR spectra and whose high-resolution structure is available. Overall, 92 proteins were selected. These proteins cover well the CATH space at the level of classes and architectures. In terms of secondary structure content, an analysis of their high-resolution structure by DSSP shows that the mean content in the different secondary structures present in cSP92 is very similar to the mean content found in the PDB. The 92-protein set is analyzed in details for the distribution of helix length, number of strands in {$\beta$}- sheets, length of {$\beta$}-strands and amino acid content, all features that may be important for the interpretation of FTIR spectra.},

  abstract = {The application of economic model predictive control (EMPC) techniques in bioprocesses is scarce due to limitations in obtaining accurate dynamic models. Simplified unstructured models (e.g., Monod) can be easily developed, but their prediction capacity is poor. On the other hand, models based on dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) of the detailed metabolic network appear as a promising alternative. However, using dFBA inside the controller leads to a bilevel optimization problem, which could require excessive computational effort. In the present work, a control approach is proposed to tackle this limitation. By combining mass balances with a surrogate model for the metabolic network, our approach provides a significant reduction in online computation while still accurately describing the microorganism of interest. A case study of a fed-batch bioreactor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for ethanol maximization was chosen to test the new approach. First, flux balance analysis simulations with Yeast 8.30 genome-scale model were performed, then a simple polynomial model was fitted to these data by partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The identification step showed that only 11 PLS components were necessary to allow the FBA to be replaced by the surrogate model with a good accuracy. The surrogate model was coupled to the EMPC, and the results were similar to those presented in the literature, where the bilevel optimization problem is explicitly solved. The EMPC was able to compensate for structural errors in the identification process, and it provided a higher ethanol titer in comparison to the open-loop operation. The results showed that applying surrogate models to dFBA is a viable strategy to the solution of a bilevel optimization problem.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Because earlier model detergency studies have shown that oil/water interfacial tension is critically important in oil removal processes, factors affecting the interfacial tension between detergent-range nonionic surfactant solutions and paraffin oil have been examined. For a given hydrophobe, equilibrium interfacial tension values increase with the length of the ethylene oxide chain in the hydrophile, because of the attendant decrease in overall surface activity. For a given degree of ethoxylation, commercial nonlphenol ethoxylates reduce interfacial tension more effectively than their secondary alcohol-based counterparts, and these in turn are more effective than commercial primary alcohol ethoxylates. Furthermore, monodisperse primary alcohol ethoxylates reduce interfacial tension more effectively than broad-range ethoxylates with similar cloud points. This observed order of effectiveness is attributed in part to variations in the extent of fractionation that occur as nonionic surfactants divide between the oil and water phases. Equilibrium interfacial tension values produced by commercial nonionic surfactants are significantly more dependent on concentration and temperature than those obtained with monodisperse ethoxylates. However, the time-course for lowering interfacial tension exhibited by monodisperse ethoxylates varies with concentration and temperature to a greater extent than that displayed by commercial products. These findings are accounted for by the combined effects of the changes in relative surface activity and partitioning that occur as the concentration and temperature are varied. An imidazoline-based quaternary fabric softener markedly increases the interfacial tension immediately following phase contact, whereas equilibrium values are only slightly higher in the presence of the softener. Appatently, preferential adsorption of the softener occurs at the interface, followed by adsorption of the nonionic surfactant at the new softener/water interface. Builders and electrolytes have no significant effect on the interfacial tension between aqueous nonionic surfactant solutions and paraffin oil. Terg-O-Tometer results demonstrate the correlation between oil/water interfacial tension and detergency.},

Molds are multicellular and form hyphae. Hyphae form filamentous structure. Bacteriophages, known as bacterial viruses, replicate within bacterial cells. Generally, bacteriophages show a unique relationship to certain species of bacteria. As with all viruses, bacteriophages consist of a genetic material surrounded by a protein capsid. The genetic material, nucleic acid, can be DNA or RNA, and the genetic material can be double stranded or single stranded. There is specificity between bacteriophages and bacteria. The structure of bacteriophages can be displayed in detail by electron microscope. In this section, morphological characteristics of molds and yeasts are examined. Isolation, enumeration, and uses of bacteriophages are also introduced through representative practices.},

  abstract = {Detailed analysis of electronic waste (e-waste) generation and composition is of utmost importance for the proper management of growing e-waste stream worldwide, containing both hazardous and valuable materials. Considering the absence of such comprehensive and up-to-date studies in Canada, this work presents the first estimate of put-on-market electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), the in-use stocks of EEE and e-waste generation in Canada from 1971 to 2030 for 51 product categories comprising 198 product types. Using a dynamic material flow analysis (MFA), the put-on-market EEE is estimated based on trade data retrieved from national and international import and export statistics, and the in-use stocks of EEE and the resulting e-waste are calculated using the Weibull distribution function. The results show that the total mass of EEE within the 60-year period is estimated to be 42.3 million tonnes, with an annual average growth rate of approximately 0.5\%. By 2030, the total accumulated in-use stock of EEE is estimated to exceed 13 million tonnes. The estimated e-waste over the 60-year timespan is 29.1 million tonnes. The total annual e-waste generation in Canada is calculated to be 252 kilo tonnes (kt) and 954~kt in the years 2000 and 2020 respectively, which is estimated to reach 1.2 million tonnes by 2030. The e-waste generation per capita increased from 8.3~kg in 2000 to 25.3~kg in 2020 and is estimated to reach 31.5~kg by 2030. This quantification provides valuable insights to policymakers for setting up targets for waste reduction and identifying the resource circularity potential for efficient management of e-waste.},

  abstract = {Current techniques for viral detection and discovery, which include culture and serological methods as well as polymer chain reaction (PCR)-based protocols, possess a variety of inherent limitations. In an effort to augment the capabilities of existing diagnostic methodologies, the use of virus-specific DNA microarray technology has been recently applied in both research and clinical settings with favorable results. The primary advantage of this approach is that DNA microarrays containing literally thousands of virus-specific sequences allow simultaneous testing for essentially all known viral species. While previous methods have been limited to testing for a single pathogen, or small numbers of specific pathogens, a panviral assay is less biased and can be designed to detect variant or even novel members of existing viral families. The use of DNA microarrays in both research and clinical settings has the potential to substantially increase the number of instances in which a virus may be identified in biological samples. With the proper bioinformatics methodologies, this technology will also maximize the probability that previously uncharacterized pathogens are detected potentially leading to an improved understanding of the etiology for many chronic human diseases. This article focuses on all aspects of virus-specific DNA microarray implementation, from array design to sample processing, amplification, and data analysis.},

In patients with anemia, the peripheral smear permits interpretation of diagnostically significant red blood cell (                 RBC                 ) findings. These include assessment of                 RBC                 shape, size, color, inclusions, and arrangement. Abnormalities of                 RBC                 shape and other                 RBC                 features can provide key information in establishing a differential diagnosis. In patients with microcytic anemia,                 RBC                 morphology can increase or decrease the diagnostic likelihood of thalassemia. In normocytic anemias, morphology can assist in differentiating among blood loss, marrow failure, and hemolysis---and in hemolysis,                 RBC                 findings can suggest specific etiologies. In macrocytic anemias,                 RBC                 morphology can help guide the diagnostic considerations to either megaloblastic or nonmegaloblastic causes. Like all laboratory tests,                 RBC                 morphologies must be interpreted with caution, particularly in infants and children. When used properly,                 RBC                 morphology can be a key tool for laboratory hematology professionals to recommend appropriate clinical and laboratory follow-up and to select the best tests for definitive diagnosis.},

Intermolecular triplexes are formed between triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFO) and target sequences on duplex DNA. Intramolecular triplexes are the major elements of H-DNAs, unusual DNA structures, which are formed in homopurine-homopyrimidine regions of supercoiled DNAs. TFOs are promising gene-drugs, which can be used in an anti-gene strategy, that attempt to modulate gene activity in vivo. Numerous chemical modifications of TFO are known. In peptide nucleic acid (PNA), the sugar-phosphate backbone is replaced with a protein-like backbone. PNAs form P-loops while interacting with duplex DNA forming triplex with one of DNA strands leaving the other strand displaced. Very unusual recombination or parallel triplexes, or R-DNA, have been assumed to form under RecA protein in the course of homologous recombination.},

The study results provide crucial information to support selection of the right drug candidates for testing in human and understanding translation from preclinical results to clinical outcomes. Many challenges are often encountered in developing phase appropriate preclinical oral formulations, including inadequate exposure due to poor solubility and/or instability in addition to the requirement for dosing flexibility and development speed. This chapter offers basic principles, general approaches, and practical considerations in developing oral formulations for preclinical studies. It provides an overview of formulation and study requirements for safety evaluation, discusses important physicochemical properties and their impact on formulation design and performance, details preclinical formulation approaches with a focus on enabling technologies for poorly water-soluble compounds, and describes current advancements in understanding of dissolution behaviors of enabling formulation and rational design of in vitro dissolution methods. It also addresses pros and cons of various formulation approaches and selections. The chapter ends with a case study that illustrates the formulation development process using a compound from real world.},

  abstract = {The red blood cell membrane is specialized to exchange chloride and bicarbonate; usually the pH gradient, the chloride ratio, and the membrane potential are tightly coupled. We review the evidence that led to the ability to separately vary inside and outside pH in red cells. The effect of pH on Na pump activity and on the selectivity of the inside and the outside transport sites is reviewed. In red blood cells, at high pH, the outside site is not selective. An increase in protons leads to an increase in K+ affinity, thus making the site more selective. The pK for this site is different in rats and humans; because of the high conservation of residues in these two species, there are only a few possible residues that can account for this difference. On the inside, work from unsided preparations suggests that, at high pH, the transport site is highly selective for Na+. Once again, an increase in protons leads to an increase in K+ affinity, but now the result is a less selective site. During their maturation, reticulocytes lose many membrane proteins. The type and fractional loss is species dependent. For example, most reticulocytes lose most of their Na pumps, retaining about 100 pumps per cell, but animals from the order Carnivora lose all their pumps. We review some of the evidence that PKC phosphorylation of N-terminus serines is responsible for endocytosis in other cell types and species variation in this region.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of the composition and structure of the mammalian cell membrane, biologists have had a clearer understanding of how substances enter and exit the cell's interior. The selectively permeable nature of the cell membrane allows the movement of some solutes and prevents the movement of others. This has important consequences for cell volume and the integrity of the cell and, as a result, is of utmost clinical importance, for example in the administration of isotonic intravenous infusions. The concepts of osmolarity and tonicity are often confused by students as impermeant isosmotic solutes such as NaCl are also isotonic; however, isosmotic solutes such as urea are actually hypotonic due to the permeant nature of the membrane. By placing red blood cells in solutions of differing osmolarities and tonicities, this experiment demonstrates the effects of osmosis and the resultant changes in cell volume. Using hemoglobin standard solutions, where known concentrations of hemoglobin are produced, the proportion of hemolysis and the effect of this on resultant hematocrit can be estimated. No change in cell volume occurs in isotonic NaCl, and, by placing blood cells in hypotonic NaCl, incomplete hemolysis occurs. By changing the bathing solution to either distilled water or isosmotic urea, complete hemolysis occurs due to their hypotonic effects. With the use of animal blood in this practical, students gain useful experience in handling tissue fluids and calculating dilutions and can appreciate the science behind clinical scenarios.},

For this purpose, the fermentation of wort with two different yeast strains and at different temperatures was monitored for nine days by FT-NIR. To correlate the collected spectra with {$^\circ$}Brix, pH and biomass, different multivariate data methodologies were applied. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS) and locally weighted regression (LWR) were used to assess the relationship between FT-NIR spectra and the abovementioned process parameters that define the beer fermentation. The accuracy and robustness of the obtained results clearly show the suitability of FT-NIR spectroscopy, combined with multivariate data analysis, to be used as a quality control tool in the beer fermentation process. FT-NIR spectroscopy, when combined with LWR, demonstrates to be a perfectly suitable quantitative method to be implemented in the production of beer.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Many valuable biopharmaceutical and biotechnological proteins have been produced in Escherichia coli, however these proteins are almost exclusively localised in the cytoplasm or periplasm. This presents challenges for purification, i.e. the removal of contaminating cellular constituents. One solution is secretion directly into the surrounding media, which we achieved via the `hijack' of the flagellar type III secretion system (FT3SS). Ordinarily flagellar subunits are exported through the centre of the growing flagellum, before assembly at the tip. However, we exploit the fact that in the absence of certain flagellar components (e.g. cap proteins), monomeric flagellar proteins are secreted into the supernatant. Results:{\enspace} We report the creation and iterative improvement of an E. coli strain, by means of a modified FT3SS and a modular plasmid system, for secretion of exemplar proteins. We show that removal of the flagellin and HAP proteins (FliC and FlgKL) resulted in an optimal prototype. We next developed a high-throughput enzymatic secretion assay based on cutinase. This indicated that removal of the flagellar motor proteins, motAB (to reduce metabolic burden) and protein degradation machinery, clpX (to boost FT3SS levels intracellularly), result in high capacity secretion. We also show that a secretion construct comprising the 5{$\prime$}UTR and first 47 amino acidsof FliC from E. coli (but no 3{$\prime$}UTR) achieved the highest levels of secretion. Upon combination, we show a 24-fold improvement in secretion of a heterologous (cutinase) enzyme over the original strain. This improved strain could export a range of pharmaceutically relevant heterologous proteins [hGH, TrxA, ScFv \-(CH2)], achieving secreted yields of up to 0.29 mg L-1, in low cell density culture. Conclusions:{\enspace} We have engineered an E. coli which secretes a range of recombinant proteins, through the FT3SS, to the extracellular media. With further developments, including cell culture process strategies, we envision further improvement to the secreted titre of recombinant protein, with the potential application for protein production for biotechnological purposes.},

In many cases it is not sufficient to just have the three-dimensional structure of a protein in H 2O or in the crystalline state. Often information on the structural properties of a protein is required in the presence of organic solvents, detergent micelles, phospholipid membranes and so on. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy {\v Z}FTIR. has been identified as one of the few techniques that can be applied for structural characterisation of proteins in such environments. Here we discuss how this technique is being used to obtain information on protein structure and stability in both aqueous and non-aqueous media.

Studies that will be used for regulatory purposes must be conducted in compliance of good laboratory practice (GLP). General toxicology studies include single-dose (acute) toxicity studies and repeat-dose toxicity studies. The purpose of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is to evaluate compound-induced adverse effects on fertility, gestation, and development of offspring. Mutagenesis refers to alterations in the information content in the DNA sequence of an organism or a cell. Genotoxicity tests include the Ames test, the micronucleus assay (MN), the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA), the comet assay, sister chromatid exchange (SCE), and cytogenetic tests. Tests for carcinogenicity present one of the greatest challenges in toxicology, and there is an ongoing need to develop more robust tests in this area. There are also various specialized toxicity tests, including skin and eye irritation tests, cutaneous sensitization tests for immunotoxicity, phototoxicity tests, and eye tests. The nervous system (NS) is responsible for a wide array of biological functions including motor, sensory, autonomic, and cognitive capabilities. Chemicals that are neurotoxic can lead to a wide spectrum of changes in the structure, function, and development of the NS. Understanding mechanisms and effects of neurotoxicity thus requires significant knowledge of the central and peripheral nervous systems.},

Estimation of stochastic disturbances as well as the impact of estimation quality of stochastic disturbances on the SMPC performance are discussed.

  abstract = {The normal mature red blood cell is a pliable biconcave disc composed of hemoglobin (25 per cent), stroma (3.5 per cent) and water (70 per cent). The arrangement of these elements in the cell is not well understood. Ordinarily, the life of an erythron is approximately 120 days and about 10,000,000 red cells are destroyed every second. Hemolysis may be said to exist when the normal rate of red blood cell destruction is increased. Although many agents may be responsible for hemolysis it is probable that, like saponins, all depend upon disruption of the cell membrane for their effect. When hemolysis occurs rapidly, particularly if it be intravascular, free hemoglobin appears in the plasma above the normal concentration of 3 mg. per cent. Above levels of 135 mg. per cent, it appears in the urine. If tubular reabsorption is impaired hemoglobinuria may exist with considerably lower plasma levels. Usually, however, red cell destruction occurs in the reticuloendothelial system with the conversion of the hemoglobin to bilirubin and, when excessive, with the production of acholuric jaundice. The breakdown of hemoglobin begins with oxidative ring rupture at the {$\alpha$}-methene group of the porphyrin fraction of the molecule, resulting in a green compound called verdohemoglobin. This loses its iron, which is stored in the form of hepatic and splenic ferritin, and becomes biliverdin which on reduction is called bilirubin. Bilirubin exists normally in concentrations of less than 1 mg. per cent in the serum and may be subdivided into two fractions: hemobilirubin and cholebilirubin. The former retains its globin, is non-dialyzable, does not pass the glomerular filter, produces the indirect van den Bergh reaction and represents the larger fraction. The latter is free of globin but is associated with plasma albumin and appears in urine when its concentration in the plasma exceeds 2 mg. per cent. In the intestinal tract bilirubin is further reduced to urobilinogen, part of which is absorbed into the portal circulation where it is almost entirely cleared by the liver and re-introduced into the bile. In the presence of impaired liver function, however, more than the usual 2 per cent of the portal bilirubin may elude the liver and gain access to the general circulation and so appear in the urine in increased amount. Table I summarizes the usually recognized causes of red blood cell destruction while Table II attempts to classify these mechanisms as they occur in disease states. How incomplete is our understanding, however, of the basic mechanisms of hemolysis is well illustrated in the case of sickle-cell anemia where a clear-cut abnormality of the red cell exists without obvious relation to the hemolytic process and where a rational form of therapy appears to have no effect. On the other hand, the excellent results obtained by splenectomy in congenital hemolytic icterus are seen to have some experimental foundation. The clinical picture of chronic hemolysis is characterized by icterus, frequent enlargement of the spleen, anemia, leukocytosis and increase in reticulocytes. The urine is ordinarily free of bile although this is not invariable. The serum bilirubin is increased and classically gives an indirect van den Bergh reaction. Urobilin is increased in the stool and urobilinogen is usually present in the urine in abnormal amounts. If the liver is damaged, however, many of these points in differential diagnosis are of no value. Therapy is often disappointing unless some specific infection can be treated, some harmful agent be removed or splenectomy be advised. The success of the latter procedure is largely limited to familial hemolytic jaundice although occasional excellent results are obtained in acquired hemolytic icterus and localized disease of the spleen. Acute hemolysis presents quite a different and more serious prospect. The sudden onset is distinguished by headache, backache and leg pains. Pain in the abdomen may be severe and mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Chills and fever are common; shock, with anuria, may supervene. Anemia and hemoglobinemia are found. Hemoglobinuria may be present in severe cases or when tubular re-absorption is defective. Transfusion is the treatment of choice since it tends to overcome the anemia, correct the shock and so increase renal blood flow. In some instances it apparently arrests the hemolytic process as well. Alkalinization of the urine remains good therapy though perhaps of secondary importance in preventing anuria.},

We investigate the characteristics of models that are good at extrapolating. We trained three fully predictive models with different representational structures (differential equations, differential equations with inheritance of rates and a network of reactions) on Saccharopolyspora erythraea shake flask fermentation data using genetic programming. The models were then tested on unseen data outside the range of the training data and the resulting performances were compared. It was found that constrained models with mathematical forms analogous to internal mass balancing and stoichiometric relations were superior to flexible unconstrained models, even though no a priori knowledge of this fermentation was used.},

Since in typical method the porogens are dispersed in the solution and flow with the polymers during the casting and the crystallinity behavior of PLA chains in the limited space cannot be tracked, in this work the processing is modified by diffusing the PLA solution into a steady salt stack. With a thermal treatment before leaching while maintaining the stable structure of the porogens stack, the crystallinity of porous foams is made possible to control. The characterizations indicate that the porous PLA foams have a lower crystallizability than the bulk materials. Pores and caves of around 250{$\mu$}m size are obtained in samples with different crystallinity. The macro-structures are not much impaired by the crystallization nevertheless the morphological effect of the heating process is still obvious.},

  abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has achieved unprecedented success in cancer treatment; However, only a subset of patients achieved clinical benefit from this treatment, underscoring the urgent need to identify new strategies to enhance the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Given the essential role of innate immunity in cancer immune surveillance, tremendous effort has been focused on the innate immune pathways that can be pharmacologically modulated to improve the clinical outcome of checkpoint inhibitors. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway plays essential roles in host defense against cancers. Activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway induces the expression of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, culminating in promotion of a robust adaptive antitumor immunity. As part of this innate immune signaling pathway, STING is ubiquitously expressed in immune and nonimmune cells. STING activation has been demonstrated to propagate the cancer immunity cycle, remodel the tumor microenvironment, and ultimately eliminate tumor cells. The immunomodulatory roles of STING enable it to be an appealing target for cancer immunotherapy. As such, STING agonists that are capable of triggering antitumor immune responses have been developed in recent years, and several of them have advanced into clinical trials. In this review, we first give an overview on the STING signaling pathway, then dissect the roles of STING activation in different steps of the cancer immunity cycle and finally discuss the development of STING agonists as well as challenges with STING activation, with the potential to make cancer immunotherapy with STING agonists more effective.},

  abstract = {Smartphone-based fluorescence imaging systems have the potential to provide convenient quantitative image guidance at the point of care. However, common approaches have required the addition of complex optical attachments, which reduce translation potential. In this study, a simple clip-on attachment appropriate for fluorescence imaging of protoporphyrin-IX (PpIX) in skin was designed using the built-in light source and ultrawide camera sensor of a smartphone. Software control for image acquisition and quantitative analysis was developed using the 10-bit video capability of the phone. Optical performance was characterized using PpIX in liquid tissue phantoms and endogenously produced PpIX in mice and human skin. The proposed system achieves a very compact form factor ({$<$}30 cm               3               ) and can be readily fabricated using widely available low-cost materials. The limit of detection of PpIX in optical phantoms was {$<$}10 nM, with good signal linearity from 10 to 1000 nM (R               2               {$>$}0.99). Both murine and human skin imaging verified that in vivo PpIX fluorescence was detected within 1 hour of applying aminolevulinic acid (ALA) gel. This ultracompact handheld system for quantification of PpIX in skin is well-suited for dermatology clinical workflows. Due to its simplicity and form factor, the proposed system can be readily adapted for use with other smartphone devices and fluorescence imaging applications. Hardware design and software for the system is made freely available on GitHub (               https://github.com/optmed/CompactFluorescenceCam               ).},

DNA triplex structures, either intermolecular triplexes formed by binding of an exogenously applied oligonucleotide to a target duplex sequence, or naturally occurring intramolecular triplexes (H-DNA) formed at endogenous mirror repeat sequences, present exploitable features that permit site-specific alteration of the genome. These structures can induce transcriptional repression and site-specific mutagenesis or recombination. Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) can bind to duplex DNA in a sequence specific fashion with high affinity, and can be used to direct DNA-modifying agents to selected sequences. H-DNA plays important roles in vivo and is inherently mutagenic and recombinogenic, such that elements of the H-DNA structure may be pharmacologically exploitable. In this review we discuss the biological consequences and therapeutic potential of triple helical DNA structures. We anticipate that the information provided will stimulate further investigations aimed toward improving DNA triplex-related gene targeting strategies for biotechnological and potential clinical applications.},

However, human DNA polymerase {$\iota$} (Pol{$\iota$}), a member of the Y family of DNA polymerases, exhibits a marked template specificity, being more efficient at incorporating the correct nucleotide opposite template purines than opposite pyrimidines. By using 7-deazaadenine and 7-deazaguanine as the templating residues, which disrupt Hoogsteen base pair formation, we show that, unlike the other DNA polymerases belonging to the A, B, or Y family, DNA synthesis by Pol{$\iota$} is severely inhibited by these N7-modified bases. These observations provide biochemical evidence that, during normal DNA synthesis, template purines adopt a syn conformation in the Pol{$\iota$} active site, enabling the formation of a Hoogsteen base pair with the incoming pyrimidine nucleotide. Additionally, mutational studies with Leu-62, which lies in close proximity to the templating residue in the Pol{$\iota$} ternary complex, have indicated that both factors, steric constraints within the active site and the stability provided by the hydrogen bonds in the Hoogsteen base pair, contribute to the efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation opposite template purines by Pol{$\iota$}.}

  abstract = {Human red blood cells (RBC) exposed to hypertonic media are subject to post-hypertonic lysis - an injury that only develops during resuspension to an isotonic medium. The nature of post-hypertonic lysis was previously hypothesized to be osmotic when cation leaks were observed, and salt loading was suggested as a cause of the cell swelling upon resuspension in an isotonic medium. However, it was problematic to account for the salt loading since the plasma membrane of human RBCs was considered impermeable to cations. In this study, the hypertonicity-related behavior of human RBCs is revisited within the framework of modern cell physiology, considering current knowledge on membrane ion transport mechanisms - an account still missing. It is recognized here that the hypertonic behavior of human RBCs is consistent with the acute regulatory volume increase (RVI) response -- a healthy physiological reaction initiated by cells to regulate their volume by salt accumulation. It is shown by reviewing the published studies that human RBCs can increase cation conductance considerably by activating cell volume-regulated ion transport pathways inactive under normal isotonic conditions and thus facilitate salt loading. A simplified physiological model accounting for transmembrane ion fluxes and membrane voltage predicts the isotonic cell swelling associated with increased cation conductance, eventually reaching hemolytic volume. The proposed involvement of cell volume regulation mechanisms shows the potential to explain the complex nature of the osmotic response of human RBCs and other cells. Cryobiological implications, including mechanisms of cryoprotection, are discussed.},

  abstract = {The microorganism Escherichia coli is commonly used for recombinant protein production. Despite several advantageous characteristics like fast growth and high protein yields, its inability to easily secrete recombinant proteins into the extracellular medium remains a drawback for industrial production processes. To overcome this limitation, a multitude of approaches to enhance the extracellular yield and the secretion efficiency of recombinant proteins have been developed in recent years. Here, a comprehensive overview of secretion mechanisms for recombinant proteins from E.~coli is given and divided into three main sections. First, the structure of the E. coli cell envelope and the known natural secretion systems are described. Second, the use and optimization of different one- or two-step secretion systems for recombinant protein production, as well as further permeabilization methods are discussed. Finally, the often-overlooked role of cell lysis in secretion studies and its analysis are addressed. So far, effective approaches for increasing the extracellular protein concentration to more than 10~g/L and almost 100\% secretion efficiency exist, however, the large range of optimization methods and their combinations suggests that the potential for secretory protein production from E. coli has not yet been fully realized.},

  abstract = {The osmometer is a device used in clinical laboratories for measuring the concentration of particles in a solution, known as the osmolar concentration. This quantity can be expressed as osmolality (in units of mmol/kg) or osmolarity (in units of mmol/L). Clinical laboratories usually measure osmolality. Osmolality is considered more precise because weight is temperature-independent.~In laboratory analysis, a dissolved substance is referred to as a solute, and the substance in which the solute is dissolved is referred to as a solvent. A solute dissolved into a solvent creates a solution. The unit for osmolar concentration or osmolality is milliosmole (abbreviated mOsm or mOsmol). For nonelectrolytes, 1 mmol equals 1 mOsm, while for electrolytes, the number of particles in a solution depends on the electrolyte's dissociation. Four colligative properties of a solvent change if a solute is dissolved into a solvent. These properties are: Osmotic pressure. Vapor pressure. Boiling point. Freezing point. These properties are tied to osmolality and depend on the solution's number of solute particles. Dissolving a solute into a solvent generally increases the osmotic pressure and boiling point and decreases the vapor pressure and freezing point of a solution. While any of the four colligative properties could be used to determine the osmolality of a solution, technical limitations restrict the commercial measurement of osmolality to freezing point, vapor pressure, and membrane osmometers. The freezing point depression method is the most common in clinical laboratories because it is the most accurate and simple method.~ The general principle of freezing point depression osmometers involves the relationship between the number of moles of dissolved solute in a solution and the change in freezing point. For example, one mole of a dissolved solute reduces the freezing point of water by approximately 1.86 degrees Celsius ({\textasciitilde}35.35 degrees Fahrenheit).~Therefore, freezing and thawing a solution and comparing the relative change in freezing point in reference to a pure solvent allows for the determination of the approximate number of moles of dissolved solute in a sample. In clinical laboratory analysis, most samples are in water-based aqueous solutions, and the reference for solutions is generally pure water. The setup of a freezing point depression osmometer includes a temperature-controlled bath to allow for sub-freezing temperatures, a thermistor probe connected to a Wheatstone bridge circuit to measure the temperature of a clinical sample, and a thermistor readout circuit, which represents a combination of a galvanometer and a potentiometer.~While many osmometers are individual tabletop devices, computerized and automatic osmometers, and handheld osmometers do exist.~Vapor pressure osmometers measure the osmolality of a solution by measuring the voltage difference between two thermistors, one exposed to a sample solution and the other exposed to only the pure solvent corresponding to the sample solution; this allows for a relationship between voltage and solute concentration to be determined, and thus the osmolality of a sample.~ On the other hand, membrane osmometers measure the flow of solvent (often water) from a pure solvent container across a semipermeable membrane into a solution containing a solute and the same solvent. The flow across the semipermeable membrane can be measured as the osmotic pressure of a sample and is related to the concentration of solute in the sample solution.~The semipermeable membrane in this device only allows the flow of solvent and blocks the flow of dissolved particles. These osmometers are limited in their application by the range of osmolality they can measure and the membrane material with which the semipermeable membrane can be made. Alternative methods to osmometers can be used to measure osmolality, including electrical conductivity and specific gravity.~Specific gravity was utilized before osmometers were practical to measure the osmolality of urine, utilizing various~instruments such as a refractometer (the measurement of the refraction of light through a fluid) or a hydrometer.~The applicability and accuracy of methods besides osmometry to determine a sample's osmolality depend on the specific method and the sample.},

  abstract = {Multipurpose solutions (MPS) often contain low concentrations of boric acid as a buffering agent. Limited published literature has suggested that boric acid and borate-buffered MPS may alter the corneal epithelium; an effect attributed to cytotoxicity induced by boric acid. However, this claim has not been substantiated. We investigated the effect of treating cells with relevant concentrations of boric acid using two cytotoxicity assays, and also assessed the impact of boric acid on corneal epithelial barrier function by measuring TEER and immunostaining for tight junction protein ZO-1 in human corneal epithelial cells. Boric acid was also assessed in an in vivo ocular model when administered for 28 days. Additionally, we evaluated Biotrue multi-purpose solution, a novel borate-buffered MPS, alone and with contact lenses for ocular compatibility in vitro and in vivo. Boric acid passed both cytotoxicity assays and did not alter ZO-1 distribution or corneal TEER. Furthermore, boric acid was well-tolerated on-eye following repeated administration in a rabbit model. Finally, Biotrue multi-purpose solution demonstrated good ocular biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. This MPS was not cytotoxic and was compatible with the eye when administered alone and when evaluated with contact lenses. We demonstrate that boric acid and a borate-buffered MPS is compatible with the ocular environment. Our findings provide evidence that ocular effects reported for some borate-buffered MPS may be incorrectly attributed to boric acid and are more likely a function of the unique combination of ingredients in the MPS formulation tested.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D)-printed scaffolds have attracted considerable attention in recent years as they provide a suitable environment for bone cell tissue regeneration and can be customized in shape. Among many other challenges, the material composition and geometric structure have major impacts on the performance of scaffolds. Hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP), as the major constituents of natural bone and teeth, possess attractive biological properties and are widely used in bone scaffold fabrication. Many fabrication methods have been investigated in attempts to achieve HA/TCP scaffolds with microporous structure enabling cell growth and nutrient transport. However, current 3D printing methods can only achieve the fabrication of HA/TCP scaffolds with certain range of microporous structure. To overcome this challenge, we developed a slurry-based microscale mask image projection stereolithography, allowing us to form a HA/TCP-based photocurable suspension with complex geometry including biomimetic features and hierarchical porosity. Here, the curing performance and physical properties of the HA/TCP suspension were investigated, and a circular movement process for the fabrication of highly viscous HA/TCP suspension was developed. Based on these investigations, the scaffold composition was optimized. We determined that a 30~wt\% HA/TCP scaffold with biomimetic hierarchical structure exhibited superior mechanical properties and porosity. Cell proliferation was investigated in vitro, and the surgery was conducted in a nude mouse in vivo model of long bone with cranial neural crest cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The results showed our 3D-printed HA/TCP scaffold with biomimetic hierarchical structure is biocompatible and has sufficient mechanical strength for surgery.},

  abstract = {The electronic industry is a fast-growing trade. Its speedy development quickly leads to obsoleting the devices. The e-plastic, as the second major component in e-waste after metal components, is costly yet challenging to recycle due to the complexities of the plastic resin mixtures. Therefore, utilising e-plastic to replace natural coarse aggregate in concrete material can reduce the environmental impact of landfilling the e-plastic and decrease the cost of concrete, making the concrete eco-friendlier. This study aims to deploy a life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the potential reduction in the environmental impact of e-plastic concrete compared among four scenarios with different types of binders, using SimaPro software. The four scenarios are built up from 1) conventional concrete, 2) concrete with 20~\% coarse aggregate replaced by e-plastic, 3) 20~\% e-plastic concrete with 30~\% cement replaced by GGBS and 4) 20~\% e-plastic concrete with 100~\% cement replaced by GGBS and fly ash. From the global warming potential (GWP) perspective, using ReCiPe 2016 midpoint (H) analysis, all the e-plastic concrete shows a positive reduction of 1.26~\%, 23.8~\% and 21.43~\% respectively compared to conventional concrete. However, the overall environmental impact shows a negative reduction, especially for scenario 3 and scenario 4. The presence of additives such as superplasticiser and alkaline solvent in the scenario 4 generates an environmental impact to the concrete from their manufacturing process. Therefore scenario 4 has a significant negative reduction in most of the indicators. Practically, e-plastic in concrete helps reduce the consumption of natural resources, lower the construction industry's environmental strain, and fix e-plastic deluged.},

  abstract = {Fermentation of sugar by Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742, for production of ethanol in a batch experiment was conducted to improve the performance of the fermentation process. The thermotolerant ability of S. cerevisiae to grow and ferment glucose at elevated temperatures similar to the optima for saccharification was investigated. The influences of temperature, substrate concentration and pH on ethanol fermentation were observed. The yield for ethanol production and changes in the fermentation pathway were compared under different conditions. When the temperature was increased to 45~{$^\circ$}C, the system still showed high cell growth and ethanol production rates, while it was inhibited at 50~{$^\circ$}C. The maximum specific growth rate and the maximum specific ethanol production rate were observed between 30 and 45~{$^\circ$}C with different initial glucose concentrations. The maximum sugar conversion at 30~{$^\circ$}C after 72~h incubation was 48.0\%, 59.9\%, 28.3\%, 13.7\% and 3.7\% for 20, 40, 80, 160 and 300~kg~m-3 of glucose concentrations respectively. Increased substrate supply did not improve the specific ethanol production rate when the pH value was not controlled. pH 4.0--5.0 was the optimal range for the ethanol production process. The highest specific ethanol production rate for all the batch experiments was achieved at pH5.0 which is 410~g~kg-1~h-1 of suspended solids (SS) which gave an ethanol conversion efficiency of 61.93\%. The highest specific ethanol production rate at 4.0 was 310~g~kg-1~h-1 of SS. A change in the main fermentation pathway was observed with various pH ranges. Formation of acetic acid was increased when the pH was below 4.0, while butyric acid was produced when the pH was higher than 5.0. In the presence of oxygen, the ethanol could be utilized by the yeast as the carbon source after other nutrients became depleted, this could not occur however under anaerobic conditions.},

Under general assumptions, we prove that the proposed controller is asymptotically stable without process disturbances and is input-to-state stable when there is a process disturbance. The proposed eNMPC is demonstrated on two case studies and compared against setpoint-tracking NMPC with setpoints determined by the steady-state real-time optimizer to show improved dynamic performance. We also highlight the capability of self-stabilization of the new eNMPC with parameter updates in the process model.},

The derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines from oocytes and embryos is fraught with disputes about the onset of human personhood. The reprogramming of somatic cells to produce induced pluripotent stem cells avoids the ethical problems specific to embryonic stem cell research. In any hSC research, however, difficult dilemmas arise regarding sensitive downstream research, consent to donate materials for hSC research, early clinical trials of hSC therapies, and oversight of hSC research. These ethical and policy issues need to be discussed along with scientific challenges to ensure that stem cell research is carried out in an ethically appropriate manner.

A challenge has been to isolate sufficiently pure Tregs and expand them to a clinical dose. However, there has been considerable progress in the development and optimization of these methods, resulting in a variety of manufacturing protocols being tested in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize methods that have been used to manufacture Tregs for clinical trials, including the choice of cell source and protocols for cell isolation and expansion. We also discuss alternative culture or genome editing methods for modulating Treg specificity, function or stability that could be applied to future clinical manufacturing protocols to increase the efficacy of Treg therapy.},

The existence of multiple forms of DNA and the uses of DNA in biological technologies is presented. DNA is also finding increasing use as a material due to its rather unusual structural and physical characteristics as well as its ready availability.},

The main force driving the correct folding mechanism is the hydrophobic effect and when this folding kinetics is altered, aggregation phenomena intervene causing the occurrence of illnesses such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. The other important effect is performed by water molecules and by their ability to form a complex network of hydrogen bonds whose dynamics influence the mobility of protein amino acids. In this work, we review the recent results obtained by means of spectroscopic techniques, such as Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, on hydrated lysozyme. In particular, we explore the Energy Landscape from the thermal region of configurational stability up to that of the irreversible denaturation. The importance of the coupling between the solute and the solvent will be highlighted as well as the different behaviors of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties of protein amino acid residues.},

This is an important question when discussing LD50 and possible alternatives. We will try to answer this question by presenting data and some views collected during almost ten years at a Swedish pharmaceutical company. We will describe how we have made use of the LD50-values in the safety evaluation process. We will compare LD50-values with the dose levels used in longterm toxicity both after single or repeated administration and with therapeutical dose levels in man for different classes of drugs. These data will enable us to demonstrate the value of the LD50-determinations. As we are of the opinion that the LD50-value itself has a limited value for the total safety evaluation of drugs we will look into the possibility of replacing the LD50-determination with something else as an indication of lethal toxicity. In order to minimize the number of animals used and the number of animals dying because of dosing in studies on lethal toxicity we will try to support a proposal to use the maximal nonlethal dose (MNLD) as an indication of lethal toxicity in small animals.},

The process is based on the extrusion of heated feedstock plastic filaments through a nozzle tip to deposit layers onto a platform to build parts layer by layer directly from a digital model of the part. The simplicity, reliability, and affordability of the FDM process have made the additive manufacturing technology widely recognized and adopted by industry, academia, and consumers. The FDM process has also been widely used by research and development sectors to improve the process, develop new materials, and apply the FDM systems in a wide range of engineering applications. This chapter describes an overview of the basic process, materials, and capabilities of the Stratasys FDM technology, and also presents a comprehensive review of research and development work undertaken using the FDM process since its inception over the past two decades.},

Above approximately 180 K the general trend in temperature dependence of half-bandwidths, peak maxima, and band area ratios of the A1 and A3 conformer bands is similar to those reported by Ansari et al. (1987. Biophys. J. 26:337) for MbCO in 75\% glycerol/water solution, but abrupt changes in slopes at approximately 180-200 K and freezing-in of conformer populations, which could be taken as indicator for glass transition of the solvent or the protein, are absent for the hydrated MbCO films. This is interpreted in terms of an exceptionally broad distribution of relaxation times, and is in accord with conclusions from recent calorimetric annealing studies of hydrated protein powders (Sartor et al. 1994. Biophys. J. 66:249). Exchange between the three A conformers does not stop at approximately 180-200 K but occurs over the whole temperature region studied. These results are then discussed with respect to MbCO's behavior in the glass--{$>$}liquid transition region of glass-forming solvents, and it is concluded that, in analogy to the behavior of low-molecular-weight compounds with a distribution of rapidly interconverting conformers, freezing-in of MbCO's A conformer populations by the solvent should not be mistaken for a glass transition of MbCO.},

  abstract = {The potential for noninvasive determinations of glucose, lactate, and ammonia in cell culture media was investigated through near-infrared spectroscopy of the 2.0--2.5 {$\mu$}m combination region. Samples taken from a three-day fibroblast culture were analyzed with standard clinical chemistry techniques and with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The data were analyzed in three phases in an attempt to solve problems of correlation in the data. First, partial least-squares regression was used to build a multivariate calibration model based on the near-infrared spectra of the cell culture media and measured reference values. Second, an independent calibration was performed with aqueous mixtures of glucose, lactate, ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine. Finally, a calibration using a combination of spectra from cell culture media samples and aqueous mixtures was performed. In each case, the spectral loadings obtained from the calibration were inspected to determine the extent of weighting given to different spectral regions. The results indicate that a selective calibration model can be produced by combining data from samples of different type. Prediction errors of 2, 8, and 15\% were obtained for glucose, lactate, and ammonia, respectively.},

  abstract = {Reverse micelles are nanometer-sized (1-10 nm) water droplets dispersed in organic media obtained by the action of surfactants. Surfactant molecules organize with the polar part to the inner side able to solubilize water and the apolar part in contact with the organic solvent. Proteins can be solubilized in the water pool of reverse micelles. Studies on the structure-function relationships of proteins in reverse micelles are very important since the microenvironment in which the protein is solubilized has physico-chemical properties distinct from a bulk aqueous solution. Some of the unique characteristics of reverse micelles make them very useful for biotechnological applications. Charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics of the protein and the selection of surfactant can be used to achieve selective solubilization of proteins. This has been used to extend the classical liquid-liquid extraction with solvents to protein bioseparation. For biocatalysis the presence of a bulk organic solvent allow synthetic reactions to be performed via the control of water content and the solubilization of hydrophobic substrates. This is accomplished with a higher interfacial area (about 100 m2/mL) than the conventional biphasic systems, minimizing mass transfer problems.},

This booklet is designed to help answer basic questions about the use of buffers in biological systems. The discussion presented here is by no means complete, but we hope it will help in the understanding of general principles involved in the use of buffers. Almost all biological processes are pH dependent. Even a slight change in pH can result in metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, resulting in severe metabolic complications. The purpose of a buffer in a biological system is to maintain intracellular and extracellular pH within a very narrow range and resist changes in pH in the presence of internal and external influences. Before we begin a discussion of buffers and how they control hydrogen ion concentrations, a brief explanation of the role of water and equilibrium constants of weak acids and bases is necessary.},

We can conclude that for the specific monitoring of maltose or maltotriose only the HPLC method was suitable. On the other hand, biosensors and spectrophotometry reflected a decrease in total sugar concentration better and were able to detect both glucose and fructose in the later stages of fermentation, while HPLC was not. This can be attributed to the low detection limits and good sensitivity of the proposed methods. For the ethanol and glycerol analysis all methods proved to be suitable. However, concerning the cost expenses and time analysis, biosensors represented the best option.},

With the advancement in the bone research area, bone implants have been under scrutiny to find a better material that could help in bone regeneration and growth. A wide range of material has been studied and examined to find the ideal combination. In this paper, a new blend of Tri-calcium phosphate (TCP), polycaprolactone (PCL) and bovine hydroxyapatite (BHA) was introduced to create scaffolds with fused deposition 3d printing. Effect of BHA concentration as a naturally derived and newcomer 3d printing material was investigated via FTIR, XRD, and SEM analyses. In vitro studies were exhibited that 15\% (wt/wt) BHA fabricated composite scaffolds possessed more bioactivity than other cases with increasing proliferation and growth rates.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a promising technique for fabricating customized tissue engineering scaffolds and implants. The scaffolds not only act as temporary support structures for bone ingrowth and tissue regeneration but also provide temporary biological functions. The complex defect sites in human knee, dental, hip, skull, and craniofacial require a precise design of scaffold to match and fit in those defect sites. These scaffolds are designed to stay in the human body as implants for longer periods. This requires matching of mechanical properties and biocompatibility of these scaffolds with surrounding hard tissues. Extensive research has been carried out to provide patients with productive and cost-effective solutions by fabricating complex and near net shape metallic scaffolds using the potential of laser-assisted AM techniques, ie, selective laser sintering (SLS) and selective laser melting (SLM). This chapter focuses on the development of metallic scaffolds and implants using such laser-assisted AM techniques. For this reason, discussion on SLS is limited to fundamentals, as this particular AM technique is not useful for fabricating metallic scaffolds. However, the discovery of SLS laid the foundation for the development of SLM by incorporating high-energy lasers, which are useful for developing near net shape and complicated metallic scaffolds with minimum defects in their microstructures. SLM has been explored exclusively for fabricating tissue engineering scaffolds and implants from a wide range of metals. This chapter elucidates the key processing parameters of SLM and their effects on the functionality of fabricated scaffolds. The progress, limitations, challenges, and potential of SLM in the manufacturing of metallic scaffolds and implants are also explained. An overview of the research gaps and future research directions is provided.},

  abstract = {Introduction The cell viability assay by alamar blue is based on the principle of reduction of the non-fluorescent reagent (resazurin) to a fluorescent compound (resarufin) by the intracellular reducing environment of living cells over time. In the present study, we have for the first time shown that even in the absence of cells, there occurs significant interaction between alamar blue and cell-culture media causing an increase in fluorescence. Methods We have used Opti-MEM, DMEM and 1:1 DMEM:Opti-MEM as three different media and determined the changes in their relative fluorescence units (RFUs) over time after the addition of 10\% (v/v) alamar blue using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. Results Our results show that upon the addition of alamar blue, there occurs a significant increase in RFUs in all the three media over time along with a significantly higher RFU for the Opti-MEM overall (p{$<$}0.05). We also show that the time-dependent change in RFU of 1:1 DMEM:Opti-MEM was more gradual compared to that of the other two media. Discussion These findings indicate that the reagent can itself interact with the media causing significantly different fluorescence over time in a manner independent from the effect of intracellular reducing environment of living cells on alamar blue. In addition our results indicate that fluorescence varies as a function of incubation time with the reagent. These findings signify the need for routine subtraction of the background fluorescence of media-only with alamar blue reagent during measurement of cell viability by this method in order to determine an accurate measurement of cell viability.},

The `resazurin reduction test' has been used for about 50 years to monitor bacterial and yeast contamination of milk, and also for assessing semen quality. Resazurin (blue and nonfluorescent) is reduced to resorufin (pink and highly fluorescent) which is further reduced to hydroresorufin (uncoloured and nonfluorescent). It is still not known how this reduction occurs, intracellularly via enzyme activity or in the medium as a chemical reaction, although the reduced fluorescent form of Alamar Blue was found in the cytoplasm and of living cells nucleus of dead cells. Recently, the dye has gained popularity as a very simple and versatile way of measuring cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. This dye presents numerous advantages over other cytotoxicity or proliferation tests but we observed several drawbacks to the routine use of Alamar Blue. Tests with several toxicants in different cell lines and rat primary hepatocytes have shown accumulation of the fluorescent product of Alamar Blue in the medium which could lead to an overestimation of cell population. Also, the extensive reduction of Alamar Blue by metabolically active cells led to a final nonfluorescent product, and hence an underestimation of cellular activity.},

Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) is a well-known method for the separation and concentration of target bacteria from a large volume of food samples. Magnetic beads functionalized with an antibody provide selectivity for target bacteria such as Escherichia coli O157:H7. Moreover, compared to conventional methods, real-time PCR enables high-sensitivity detection of target bacteria. The method proposed in this study involves three steps: (1) pre-enrichment, (2) automated IMS and concentration of target bacteria, and (3) detection of target bacteria by real-time PCR. Using food samples with a working sample volume as large as 250 mL, the whole process only requires 3 h. As a result, target bacteria in the range of 101--102 colony-forming units per mg or g of sample can be detected in food samples, such as milk, ground beef, and cabbage, by using the proposed approach. We anticipate that the automated IMS system combined with real-time PCR will contribute to the development of a fully automated system for detecting foodborne bacteria and serve as a multi-tester for a variety of bacterial strains in the capacity of a sample-to-answer device in the near future.},

  abstract = {Critical micelle concentration (CMC) is the main chemical--physical parameter to be determined for pure surfactants for their characterization in terms of surface activity and self-assembled aggregation. The CMC values can be calculated from different techniques (e.g., tensiometry, conductivity, fluorescence spectroscopy), able to follow the variation of a physical property with surfactant concentrations. Different mathematical approaches have been applied for the determination of CMC values from the raw experimental data. Most of them are independent of the operator, despite not all of the fitting procedures employed so far can be applied in all techniques. In this experimental work, the second derivative of the experimental data has been proposed as a unique approach to determine the CMC values from different techniques (tensiometry, conductimetry, densimetry, spectrofluorimetry, and high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy). To this end, the CMC values of five different surfactants, specifically three anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium deoxycolate, and N-lauroyl sarcosinate) and two nonionic, such as polyethylene glycol ester surfactants [polyethylenglicol (8) monostearate and polyethylenglicol (8) monolaurate], have been determined by this approach. The ``second-derivate'' approach provides a reliable determination of the CMC values among all of the techniques investigated, which were comparable to those calculated by the other operator-free routinely methods employed, such as segmental linear regression or Boltzmann regression. This study also highlighted the strengths and shortcomings of each technique over the others, providing an overview of the CMC values of commonly used anionic and nonionic surfactants in the pharmaceutical field, determined by employing different experimental approaches.}

  abstract = {Examination of the peripheral blood smear should be considered, along with review of the results of peripheral blood counts and red blood cell indices, an essential component of the initial evaluation of all patients with hematologic disorders. The examination of blood films stained with Wright's stain frequently provides important clues in the diagnosis of anemias and various disorders of leukocytes and platelets. Normal human red blood cells are biconcave disks (diskocytes) with a mean diameter of about 7.5 {$\mu$}m. Erythrocytes are slightly smaller than small lymphocytes. The hemoglobin of red cells is located peripherally, leaving an area of central pallor equal to approximately 30 to 45\% of the diameter of the cells. Cells of normal size and hemoglobin content (color) are termed normocytic and normochromic. Larger than normal erythrocytes are macrocytes (diameter greater than 9 {$\mu$}m); small red cells are microcytes (diameter less than 6 {$\mu$}m); and those with central pallor greater than 50\% of the diameter are hypochromic. Abnormal variability in size is termed anisocytosis; unusual variation in shape is called poikilocytosis; and significant differences among erythrocytes in the amount of central pallor is referred to as anisochromia. Polychromatophilia means the erythrocytes have a blue-gray hue to the color of their cytoplasm. From a diagnostic standpoint, poikilocytosis has no specificity, but the recognition of specific forms of poikilocytes (irregularly shaped cells) often points to specific disorders. Spherocytes are round, densely staining red cells that lack central pallor and have a smaller than normal diameter. In stomatocytes, the area of central pallor is elliptical rather than round, giving the cell the appearance of the opening of a mouth (stoma). Target cells (codocytes) have a centrally located disk of hemoglobin surrounded by an area of pallor with an outer rim of hemoglobin adjacent to the cell membrane giving the cell the appearance of a target. Leptocytes (or wafer cells) are thin, flat cells with the hemoglobin at the periphery of the cell. Sickle cells (drepanocytes) are elongated, sometimes crescent-shaped, erythrocytes with pointed ends. Elliptocytes (ovalocytes) range from slightly oval to elongated cigar-shaped forms. Teardrop erythrocytes (dacryocytes) are red cells with one end round and the other end more pointed. Acanthocytes have several (usually 3 to 7) irregularly spaced blunted projections from the margin of the cells. Echinocytes are also cells with cytoplasmic projections, but in contrast to acanthocytes, the projections are typically evenly spaced on the cell surface, more numerous (often 10 to 15), and frequently have sharper points. Schizocytes (schistocytes) are fragmented erythrocytes appearing in a variety of morphologic forms such as small triangular erythrocytes, helmet cells, and normal-size erythrocytes with 2 to 3 pointed surface projections (keratocytes, or "horn cells"). Round erythrocytes with a single, elliptical or round surface defect are termed bite cells. Rouleaux formation is a phrase denoting the stacking of erythrocytes, generally in a curving pattern. Morphologic identification of inclusion bodies within erythrocytes can be helpful clinically. Howell--Jolly bodies are purple spheres, usually about 0.5 {$\mu$}m in diameter, presenting singly, or rarely multiply, in the cytoplasm. Basophilic stippling of erythrocytes refers to numerous very small coarse or fine blue granules within the cytoplasm. When the stippled particles are due to iron granules (demonstrable by the Prussian blue stain), they are termed Pappenheimer bodies. Malaria parasites may appear as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. Platelets overlying erythrocytes may be mistaken for erythrocyte inclusions. There are a number of important morphologic abnormalities of mature granulocytes. Cytoplasmic vacuoles may be recognized. Toxic granulation refers to small, dark blue-staining granules. D{\"o}hle bodies are light blue cytoplasmic inclusions, 1 to 2 {$\mu$}m in diameter. The Pelger--Hu{\"e}t anomaly, a disorder characterized by impaired nuclear segmentation of mature neutrophilic granulocytes, appears morphologically as cells with bilobed nuclei (dumbbell or eyeglass shapes) or with round or oval nuclei (Stodtmeister cells). Hypersegmented neutrophils are cells in which there are six or more nuclear lobes. Reactive lymphocytes are usually larger than small lymphocytes, may have cytoplasmic vacuolization, sometimes have deep blue staining of the periphery of the cytoplasm, and contain nuclei that may be kidney bean or monocytoid in shape. Most platelets in the peripheral blood have diameters between 1 and 3 {$\mu$}m. Platelets greater than 3 {$\mu$}m in diameter are "large" (megathrombocytes). In a normal person usually less than 5\% of the platelets appear large. Figure 155.1 shows examples of morphologically normal and abnormal erythrocytes.},

  abstract = {Monitoring the consumption of sugars during fermentation is a key to optimizing product formation and maintaining a healthy environment for microorganisms. Difficulty arises in the availability of a rapid, inexpensive and sensitive method for the detection of sugars because fermentation media are a complex mix of nutrients, cell debris, waste and target products. A method involving reaction-based UV--Vis spectrophotometry for the quantitative determination of xylose as the target sugar was developed. Factors affecting xylose concentration measurements such as hydrochloric acid concentration, heating time and the amount of Fe3+ catalyst were investigated. A~continuous scan revealed the working wavelength to be 671~nm. The effect of other components in the fermentation broth was found to be negligible. Absorbance shows a linear relationship with xylose concentration within a range of 0.1--0.5~g/L. Xylose concentrations from fermentation samples obtained at specific time intervals (0--168~h) were determined with the method and compared with YSI 2700, an enzyme electrode, HPLC-ELSD method, currently a common technique for measuring xylose and GC aldononitrile sugar derivatization method. Dilution is necessary for comparable xylose concentrations with YSI 2700 and HPLC-ELSD. Xylose concentration measurements obtained with the UV--Vis spectrophotometric method although quantitatively comparable to HPLC-ELSD xylose measurements were easily and conveniently obtained compared to YSI 2700, HPLC-ELSD and GC derivatization methods.},

  abstract = {"Did we but know the mechanical affections of the particles of rhubarb, hemlock, opium, and a man...we should be able to tell beforehand that rhubarb will purge, hemlock kill and opium make a man sleepy..." -~John Locke:~Essay Concerning Human Understanding  Pharmacodynamics is the study of a drug's molecular, biochemical, and physiologic effects or actions. It comes from the Greek words~"pharmakon,"~meaning "drug," and "dynamikos," meaning "power."~All drugs produce their effects by interacting with biological structures or targets at the molecular level to induce a change in how the target molecule functions in regard to subsequent intermolecular interactions. These interactions include receptor binding, post-receptor effects, and chemical interactions. Examples of these types of interactions include (1) drugs binding to an active site of an enzyme, (2) drugs that interact with cell surface signaling proteins to disrupt downstream signaling, and (3) drugs that act by binding molecules like tumor necrosis factor (TNF).~ Subsequent to the drug-target interaction occurring downstream, effects are elicited, which can be measured by biochemical or clinical means. Examples of this include the (1) inhibition of platelet aggregation after administering aspirin, (2) reduction of blood pressure after ACE inhibitors, and~(3) the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin.~ While these examples seem obvious, the administration of the preceding drug examples should be kept in mind, so practitioners do~not administer these drugs to inhibit platelet aggregation, lower blood pressure, or lower blood glucose but to reduce the risks of cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction,~and renal and eye complications through the drug's pharmacodynamic effects.~It is important for healthcare practitioners~they are treating the patient, not the symptom or the lab value. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are the two branches of pharmacology, with pharmacodynamics studying the action of the drug on the organism and pharmacokinetics studying the effect the organism has on the drug. Pharmacodynamic actions include: Stimulating activity by directly inhibiting a receptor and its downstream effects. Depressing activity by direct receptor inhibition and its downstream effects. Antagonistic or blocking a receptor by binding to~it but not activating it. Stabilizing action, where the drug apparently behaves as neither an agonist nor antagonist~. Direct chemical reactions (beneficial in therapy and also as an adverse event). Any~of these factors can work both therapeutically as well as precipitate an adverse event.},

However, to realize its full potential to support these goals, several problems, such as fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability and different conceptualization of the data must be overcome. To provide the community with a resource free of these hurdles, we have developed DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org), one of the largest available collections of genes and variants involved in human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype--phenotype relationships. The information is accessible through a web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL endpoint, scripts in several programming languages and an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform that can be used for different research purposes including the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of specific human diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypothesis on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract{\enspace} This review discusses the organization and regulation of the glycolytic pathway in plants and compares and contrasts plant and nonplant glycolysis. Plant glycolysis exists both in the cytosol and plastid, and the parallel reactions are catalyzed by distinct nuclear-encoded isozymes. Cytosolic glycolysis is a complex network containing alternative enzymatic reactions. Two alternate cytosolic reactions enhance the pathway's ATP yield through the use of pyrophosphate in place of ATP. The cytosolic glycolytic network may provide an essential metabolic flexibility that facilitates plant development and acclimation to environmental stress. The regulation of plant glycolytic flux is assessed, with a focus on the fine control of enzymes involved in the metabolism of fructose-6-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. Plant and nonplant glycolysis are regulated from the ``bottom up'' and ``top down,'' respectively. Research on tissue- and developmental-specific isozymes of plant glycolytic enzymes is summarized. Potential pitfalls associated with studies of glycolytic enzymes are considered. Some glycolytic enzymes may be multifunctional proteins involved in processes other than carbohydrate metabolism.},

Therefore, a potential use of most of secretion systems as pro\- duction platforms at large scales are still limited.

Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture-based methods has increased, despite its lack of real-time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive. Herein, ``Lab-in-a-Package'' is presented, a platform capable of sampling, concentrating, and detecting target pathogens within closed food packaging, without intervention. This system consists of a newly designed packaging tray and reagent-infused membrane that can be paired universally with diverse pathogen sensors. The inclined food packaging tray maximizes fluid localization onto the sensing interface, while the membrane acts as a reagent-immobilizing matrix and an antifouling barrier for the sensor. The platform is substantiated using a newly discovered               Salmonella               -responsive nucleic acid probe, which enables hands-free detection of 10               3               colony forming units (CFU) g               -1               target pathogen in a packaged whole chicken.

Employing Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and surface tensiometry, we quantify the effects of surfactant concentration (0.6--15 wt\%), temperature (5--40 {$^\circ$}C) and added salt ({$\leq$}0.35 M Na2SO4). Spherical micelles form at low NaLAS ({$\leq$}2.6 wt\%) concentration in water, and become elongated with increasing concentration and decreasing temperature. Addition of salt reduces the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and thus promotes the formation of micelles. At fixed NaLAS concentration, salt addition causes spherical micelles to grow into cylindrical micelles, and then multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), which we examine by SANS and cryo-TEM. Above a threshold salt concentration, the MLVs reach diameters of 100 s of nm to few {$\mu$}m, eventually causing precipitation. While the salt concentrations associated with the micelle-to-cylinder transformation increase only slightly with temperature, those required for the cylinder-to-MLV transformation exhibit a pronounced, linear temperature dependence, which we examine in detail. Our study establishes a solution structure map for this model anionic surfactant in water, quantifying the combined roles of concentration, temperature and salt, at practically relevant conditions.},

  abstract = {In this modern era, tissue engineering is an extremely rapid emergent area in the scientific field. The damaged organs, cells, or tissues can be replaced or repaired using biocompatible and bioactive materials similar to the body's native cells or tissues. Conventionally, the renovation of bony defects has utilized the bone grafts, and all the drawbacks of these grafts were overcome by utilizing nanotechnology by developing biomaterials. In nanotechnology, various biomaterials such as nanotubes, nanofibers, nanodevices, and nanoparticles are utilized due to their mimicking ability of native organs or tissues engineering. Largely composed of nanometer-scale proteins readily interact with these nanomaterials and produce favorable cell or tissue growth. Likely, three-dimensional (3D) organ printing is a significant part of ongoing development in tissue designing and regenerative medication. 3D organ printing intends to make 3D living organ analogs and develop alongside progress in 3D printing strategies. Different scopes of computer helped 3D printing strategies have been applied to arrange living cells and biomaterials and support biochemical elements inside preplanned 3D organ analogs. From these tissue engineering techniques, current therapies for tissue regeneration got revolutionized, and the life qualities of patients are increased. This chapter describes the recent developments, current research, how they are changing or simplifying tissue transportation, and future directions of these two potential fields' nanotechnology and organ 3D printing for tissue engineering.},

The scaffolds were produced by mixing precompacted composite granules ({$\beta$}-TCP with 40vol\% PLA) of different size and density with salt particles followed by high pressure consolidation (at room temperature or 120{$^\circ$}C) and porogen dissolution. The scaffolds' compressive strength and Darcy's permeability were found to be inversely related and to be strongly dependent on the processing parameters. The use of precompacted granules instead of the loose {$\beta$}-TCP-PLA powder allowed us to increase permeability by three orders of magnitude while maintaining load bearing characteristics. Scaffolds with 50\% porosity prepared from large (300-420{$\mu$}m) composite granules of {$\beta$}-TCP-40vol\% PLA and salt porogen particles of comparable size exhibited the best combination of compressive strength (4-6MPa) and permeability (1.3-1.6{\texttimes}10(-10)m(2)) falling within the range of trabecular bone.},

To reach an integrative view on the many roles played by this enzyme, we characterized a homozygous gapc-1 null mutant and an as-GAPC1 line of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Both mutant plant lines show a delay in growth, morphological alterations in siliques, and low seed number. Embryo development was altered, showing abortions and empty embryonic sacs in basal and apical siliques, respectively. The gapc-1 line shows a decrease in ATP levels and reduced respiratory rate. Furthermore, both lines exhibit a decrease in the expression and activity of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase and reduced levels of pyruvate and several Krebs cycle intermediates, as well as increased reactive oxygen species levels. Transcriptome analysis of the gapc-1 mutants unveils a differential accumulation of transcripts encoding for enzymes involved in carbon partitioning. According to these studies, some enzymes involved in carbon flux decreased (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, NAD-malic enzyme, glucose-6-P dehydrogenase) or increased (NAD-malate dehydrogenase) their activities compared to the wild-type line. Taken together, our data indicate that a deficiency in the cytosolic GAPC activity results in modifications of carbon flux and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to an alteration of plant and embryo development with decreased number of seeds, indicating that GAPC-1 is essential for normal fertility in Arabidopsis plants.},

  abstract = {Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that presents as a hypermetabolic response to potent volatile anesthetic gases such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane and the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and rarely, in humans, to stressors such as vigorous exercise and heat. The incidence of MH reactions ranges from 1:10,000 to 1: 250,000 anesthetics. However, the prevalence of the genetic abnormalities may be as great as one in 400 individuals. MH affects humans, certain pig breeds, dogs and horses. The classic signs of MH include hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, acidosis, hyperkalaemia, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis, all related to a hypermetabolic response. The syndrome is likely to be fatal if untreated. An increase in end-tidal carbon dioxide despite increased minute ventilation provides an early diagnostic clue. In humans the syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, while in pigs it is autosomal recessive. Uncontrolled rise of myoplasmic calcium, which activates biochemical processes related to muscle activation leads to the pathophysiologic changes. In most cases, the syndrome is caused by a defect in the ryanodine receptor. Over 400 variants have been identified in the RYR1 gene located on chromosome 19q13.1, and at least 34 are causal for MH. Less than 1~\% of variants have been found in CACNA1S but not all of these are causal. Diagnostic testing involves the in vitro contracture response of biopsied muscle to halothane, caffeine, and in some centres ryanodine and 4-chloro-m-cresol. Elucidation of the genetic changes has led to the introduction of DNA testing for susceptibility to MH. Dantrolene sodium is a specific antagonist and should be available wherever general anesthesia is administered. Increased understanding of the clinical manifestation and pathophysiology of the syndrome, has lead to the mortality decreasing from 80~\% thirty years ago to {$<$}5~\% in 2006.},

Hydroxyapatite and silica containing scaffolds are successfully obtained by stereolithography. Influence of hydroxyapatite/silica ratio on the bioactivity, biodegradability and mechanical properties of the scaffolds is also studied. It was observed that higher concentrations of hydroxyapatite led to improved mechanical strength of the scuffolds but increased viscosity of the slurry, affecting printability.

  abstract = {In the analysis of quantitative PCR (qPCR) data, the quantification cycle (Cq) indicates the position of the amplification curve with respect to the cycle axis. Because Cq is directly related to the starting concentration of the target, and the difference in Cq values is related to the starting concentration ratio, the only results of qPCR analysis reported are often Cq, {$\Delta$}Cq or {$\Delta\Delta$}Cq values. However, reporting of Cq values ignores the fact that Cq values may differ between runs and machines, and, therefore, cannot be compared between laboratories. Moreover, Cq values are highly dependent on the PCR efficiency, which differs between assays and may differ between samples. Interpreting reported Cq values, assuming a 100\% efficient PCR, may lead to assumed gene expression ratios that are 100-fold off. This review describes how differences in quantification threshold setting, PCR efficiency, starting material, PCR artefacts, pipetting errors and sampling variation are at the origin of differences and variability in Cq values and discusses the limits to the interpretation of observed Cq values. These issues can be avoided by calculating efficiency-corrected starting concentrations per reaction. The reporting of gene expression ratios and fold difference between treatments can then easily be based on these starting concentrations.},

  abstract = {Value-retention processes (VRPs), a collective term that includes practices of direct reuse, repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing, can facilitate the cycling of products and components within a circular economy (CE). VRPs are often presented as alternatives to conventional manufacturing and consumption, and as mechanisms for avoiding negative environmental impacts (e.g., landfill) and mitigating issues of material scarcity. However, these practices are typically lumped together under generic `reuse' strategies within sustainable materials management programs and policies. Further, there is a lack of clarity and data regarding how VRPs differ, and the extent to which they contribute to the avoidance of negative environmental and economic impacts. Using novel integrated product-, process, and economy-level models, we quantify select environmental and economic impact metrics for VRPs and conventional manufacturing across six case study products, in two industrialized economies (USA and China). Using this novel methodology, we demonstrate a basis for clear differentiation of VRPs as distinct strategies within a CE, and show that each VRP offers differing forms of value (e.g. cost reduction, labor opportunity, and material retention) and differing degrees of environmental and economic impacts (e.g., primary material requirement, embodied emissions, process emissions). In all cases, the product- and process-level comparative analyses indicate that VRPs present a clear opportunity for significantly reduced environmental impacts, relative to conventional manufacturing. This novel methodology provides an adaptive, comprehensive model that can support the decision of whether or not to engage in VRPs. By quantifying and evaluating VRPs in terms of their relative environmental and economic performance, the distinct avenues, expectations and outcomes for CE can be better integrated across diverse industry and product portfolios (International Resource Panel [29]).},

Protein interaction networks are useful because of making basic scientific abstraction and improving biological and biomedical applications. Based on principle roles of proteins in biological function, their interactions determine molecular and cellular mechanisms, which control healthy and diseased states in organisms. Therefore, such networks facilitate the understanding of pathogenic (and physiologic) mechanisms that trigger the onset and progression of diseases. Consequently, this knowledge can be translated into effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the results of several studies have proved that the structure and dynamics of protein networks are disturbed in complex diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. Based on such relationship, a novel paradigm is suggested in order to confirm that the protein interaction networks can be the target of therapy for treatment of complex multi-genic diseases rather than individual molecules with disrespect the network.},

Today the introduction of safe and efficient carriers is being considered. Due to its generally round shape, and the volume that is enclosed by its membrane and cell wall, it is used to encapsulate active materials to protect them from degradation or to introduce a sustained release drug delivery system. Providing the best conditions in order to achieve the best morphological properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a carrier. Methods In this research, the most suitable growth condition of yeast cells which provides the best size for use as drug carriers was found by a bioreactor in a synthetic culture medium. Yeast cell reproduction and growth curves were obtained, based on pour plate colony counting data and UV/Visible sample absorption at 600 nm. Yeast cell growth patterns and growth rates were determined by Matlab mathematical software. Results Results showed that pH=4 and dissolving oxygen (DO) 5\% was the best condition for yeast cells to grow and reproduce. This condition also provided the largest size (2 {\texttimes} 3 {$\mu$}) yeast cells. Conclusion Owing to the yeast cells' low-cost production and their structural characteristics, they could be used as potent drug carriers.

Experimental success relies on the ability of a scientist to sterilize work surfaces and equipment as well as prevent contact of sterile instruments and solutions with non-sterile surfaces. Here we present the steps for several plating methods routinely used in the laboratory to isolate, propagate, or enumerate microorganisms such as bacteria and phage. All five methods incorporate aseptic technique, or procedures that maintain the sterility of experimental materials. Procedures described include (1) streak-plating bacterial cultures to isolate single colonies, (2) pour-plating and (3) spread-plating to enumerate viable bacterial colonies, (4) soft agar overlays to isolate phage and enumerate plaques, and (5) replica-plating to transfer cells from one plate to another in an identical spatial pattern. These procedures can be performed at the laboratory bench, provided they involve non-pathogenic strains of microorganisms (Biosafety Level 1, BSL-1). If working with BSL-2 organisms, then these manipulations must take place in a biosafety cabinet. Consult the most current edition of the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) as well as Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for Infectious Substances to determine the biohazard classification as well as the safety precautions and containment facilities required for the microorganism in question. Bacterial strains and phage stocks can be obtained from research investigators, companies, and collections maintained by particular organizations such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). It is recommended that non-pathogenic strains be used when learning the various plating methods. By following the procedures described in this protocol, students should be able to: \ding{108} Perform plating procedures without contaminating media. \ding{108} Isolate single bacterial colonies by the streak-plating method. \ding{108} Use pour-plating and spread-plating methods to determine the concentration of bacteria. \ding{108} Perform soft agar overlays when working with phage. \ding{108} Transfer bacterial cells from one plate to another using the replica-plating procedure. \ding{108} Given an experimental task, select the appropriate plating method.},

This comprehensive book presents updated information on all aspects of bacterial protein secretion encompassing: Individual secretory systems-Sec, Tat, and T1SS through the newly discovered T9SS Mechanisms, structures, and functions of bacterial secretion systems Lipoprotein sorting pathways, outer membrane vesicles, and the sortase system Structures and roles of surface organelles, including flagella, pili, and curli Emerging technologies and translational implications Protein Secretion in Bacteria serves as both an introductory guide for students and postdocs, and a ready reference for seasoned researchers whose work touches on protein export and secretion. This volume synthesizes the diversity of mechanisms of bacterial secretion across the microbial world into a digestible resource to stimulate new research, inspire continued identification and characterization of novel systems, and bring about new ways to manipulate these systems for biotechnological, preventative, and therapeutic applications"--},

  abstract = {Heat-resistant moulds (HRMs) are well known for their ability to survive pasteurization and spoil high-acid food products, which is of great concern for processors of fruit-based products worldwide. Whilst the majority of the studies on HRMs over the last decades have addressed their inactivation, few data are currently available regarding their contamination levels in fruit and fruit-based products. Thus, this study aimed to quantify and identify heat-resistant fungal ascospores from samples collected throughout the processing of pasteurized highacid fruit products. In addition, an assessment on the effect of processing on the contamination levels of HRMs in these products was carried out. A total of 332 samples from 111 batches were analyzed from three processing plants (=three processing lines): strawberry puree (n = 88, Belgium), concentrated orange juice (n = 90, Brazil) and apple puree (n = 154, the Netherlands). HRMs were detected in 96.4\% (107/111) of the batches and 59.3\% (197/332) of the analyzed samples. HRMs were present in 90.9\% of the samples from the strawberry puree processing line (1--215 ascospores/100 g), 46.7\% of the samples from the orange juice processing line (1--200 ascospores/100 g) and 48.7\% of samples from the apple puree processing line (1--84 ascospores/100 g). Despite the high occurrence, the majority (76.8\%, 255/332) of the samples were either not contaminated or presented low levels of HRMs ({$<$} 10 ascospores/100 g). For both strawberry puree and concentrated orange juice, processing had no statistically significant effect on the levels of HRMs (p {$>$} 0.05). On the contrary, a significant reduction (p {$<$} 0.05) in HRMs levels was observed during the processing of apple puree. Twelve species were identified belonging to four genera - Byssochlamys, Aspergillus with Neosartorya-type ascospores, Talaromyces and Rasamsonia. N. fumigata (23.6\%), N. fischeri (19.1\%) and B. nivea (5.5\%) were the predominant species in pasteurized products. The quantitative data (contamination levels of HRMs) were fitted to exponential distributions and will ultimately be included as input to spoilage risk assessment models which would allow better control of the spoilage of heat treated fruit products caused by heat-resistant moulds.},

A detailed description of the local and global rearrangement of the secondary structure upon a temperature increase, in the range 295 to 365 K, was obtained through the analysis of the amide I band. Thermodynamic parameters for the melting, and the effect of the co-solvent in determining a change in thermal stability of the protein were evaluated. The protein-protein interactions were also followed as a function of temperature: a strong dependence of the cluster stability and aggregation yield on the solvent composition was observed. Finally, FTIR spectra taken at successive time steps of the aggregation enabled intermolecular contacts to be monitored as a function of time, and kinetic information to be obtained showing that both unfolded and folded states of lysozyme act as reactants for the clustering event.},

  abstract = {Aims The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the influence of physical movement on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, (2) to establish a video-NIRS system which simultaneously records NIRS data and the subject's movement, and (3) to measure the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration change ({$\Delta$}oxy-Hb) during a word fluency (WF) task. Experiment 1 In 5 healthy volunteers, we measured the oxy-Hb and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) concentrations during 11 kinds of facial, head, and extremity movements. The probes were set in the bilateral frontal regions. The deoxy-Hb concentration was increased in 85\% of the measurements. Experiment 2 Using a pillow on the backrest of the chair, we established the video-NIRS system with data acquisition and video capture software. One hundred and seventy-six elderly people performed the WF task. The deoxy-Hb concentration was decreased in 167 subjects (95\%). Experiment 3 Using the video-NIRS system, we measured the {$\Delta$}oxy-Hb, and compared it with the results of the WF task. {$\Delta$}oxy-Hb was significantly correlated with the number of words. Conclusion Like the blood oxygen level-dependent imaging effect in functional MRI, the deoxy-Hb concentration will decrease if the data correctly reflect the change in neural activity. The video-NIRS system might be useful to collect NIRS data by recording the waveforms and the subject's appearance simultaneously.},

A photo-polymerisable aqueous resin comprising PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA-based macromer, visible light photo-initiator, dye and inhibitor in DMSO/water was used to build the structures. Porous and non-porous hydrogels with well-defined architectures and good mechanical properties were prepared. Porous hydrogel structures with a gyroid pore network architecture showed narrow pore size distributions, excellent pore interconnectivity and good mechanical properties. The structures showed good cell seeding characteristics, and human mesenchymal stem cells adhered and proliferated well on these materials.},

  abstract = {In this theoretical study, a framework for simulation and optimization of diauxie-involved fed-batch fermentative succinate production is proposed. In the proposed method, for the first time, diauxie is employed as a considerable phenomenon to decrease the level of undesired byproduct during the fermentative process. For this aim, an engineered mutant strain of Escherichia coli K-12, termed AB3, is considered. A hybrid-neural modeling framework is constructed based on dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) in which aerobic-condition-associated diauxie phenomenon (consumption of produced acetate) is included. The DFBA model is built using an in silico genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction with deletions of pfl, adhE, and ldhA genes. The intracellular description of carbon metabolism is simulated by a multilayer-perceptron (MLP) network to prepare the hybrid-neural model. First, model parameters are calculated by dynamic optimization. Then, a two-step bioprocess is considered in which a fed-batch aerobic step is followed by an anaerobic one with time-varying exponential feeding profiles. Optimal operating policies are determined using differential evolution method. The obtained strategy significantly increases the production of succinate compared to acetate (the major undesired byproduct). The proposed method can be used to study the potential of mutant strains for producing valuable metabolites in time-varying scenarios. In addition, it is shown that diauxie plays a key role in bioprocesses that can be used for preliminary purifications.},

However, the use of conventional microbiological methods for pathogen detection is often limited by the time required to complete the assays. The aim of this study was to develop a DNA microarray assay to detect 8 species of pathogenic bacteria, i.e., Vibrio harveyi, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. anguillarum, V. cholerae, Nocardia seriolae, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Streptococcus iniae, in cultured aquatic animals. Probes were designed according to a variable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and gryB sequences, and 23 probes were finally selected by hybridization with 25 bacterial type cultures. The microarray sensitivity for V. anguillarum detection in healthy fish blood was {$\geq$}100CFU/mL. Pathogenic bacteria in blood samples from 21 diseased aquacultural samples were analyzed in a blinded fashion by using the microarray, conventional culture, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods; the results of the microarray assay agreed well with those of the conventional culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. The results of this study show that the microarray method described is suitable for preliminary diagnoses or for confirmation of the main potential pathogens in aquatic animals.},

It is known that the two strands of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) have negative charge due to phosphate group. Cations in the form of salt in the solution, act as shielding agents thereby reducing the repulsion between these strands. We study several heterogeneous DNA molecules. We calculate the phase diagrams for DNA molecules in thermal as well as in force ensembles using Peyrard--Bishop--Dauxois (PBD) model. The dissociation and the stacking energies are the two most important factors that play an important role in the DNA stability. With suitable modifications in the model parameters we investigate the role of cation concentration on the stability of different heterogeneous DNA molecules. The objective of this work is to understand how these cations modify the strength of different pairs or bases along the strand. The phase diagram for the force ensemble case (a dsDNA is pulled from an end) is compared with the experimental results.},

The solvent-casting particulate leaching (SCPL) technique, that is already a standard method to produce polymer-based scaffolds for bone tissue repair, is proposed here to fabricate innovative 3D porous structures to mimic the bone marrow niche in vitro. Two different polymers, namely a rigid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and a flexible polyurethane (PU), were evaluated to the purpose, whereas NaCl, in the form of common salt table, resulted to be an efficient porogen. The adoption of an appropriate polymer-to-salt ratio, experimentally defined as 1:4 for both PMMA and PU, gave place to a rich and interconnected porosity, ranging between 82.1\,vol\% and 91.3\,vol\%, and the choice of admixing fine-grained or coarse-grained salt powders allowed to control the final pore size. The mechanical properties under compression load were affected both by the polymer matrix and by the scaffold's architecture, with values of the elastic modulus indicatively varying between 29\,kPa and 1283\,kPa. Preliminary tests performed with human stromal HS-5 cells co-cultured with leukemic cells allowed us to conclude that stromal cells grown associated to the supports keep their well-known protective and pro-survival effect on cancer cells, indicating that these devices can be very useful to mimic the bone marrow microenvironment and therefore to assess the efficacy of novel therapies in pre-clinical studies.},

  abstract = {In biotechnology, few online measurements of biological variables are available. This fact hampers effective monitoring and control in the fermentation field. A novel approach to this is the use of a computer to combine outputs of online sensors for physical and chemical parameters to estimate directly otherwise unaccessible biological quantities like biomass. Here, a sensor configuration is presented for the online computation of the oxygen uptake rate. The equations that have to be implemented on the digital machine are derived and a case study on the fermentation of the antibiotic Gramicidine-S is performed and discussed. The experiments indicate that for a major part of the growth and fermentation period, the computer is suitable for the evaluation of the biomass based on oxygen uptake estimates. Consequently, the process can be monitored online.},

  abstract = {Background Ethanol concentration (PE), ethanol productivity (QP) and sugar consumption (SC) are important values in industrial ethanol production. In this study, initial sugar and nitrogen (urea) concentrations in sweet sorghum stem juice (SSJ) were optimized for high PE ({$\geq$}10\%, v/v), QP, ({$\geq$}2.5\,g/L{$\cdot$}h) and SC ({$\geq$}90\%) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae SSJKKU01. Then, repeated-batch fermentations under normal gravity (NG) and high gravity (HG) conditions were studied. Results The initial sugar at 208\,g/L and urea at 2.75\,g/L were the optimum values to meet the criteria. At the initial yeast cell concentration of {\textasciitilde}1\,{\texttimes}\,108\,cells/mL, the PE, QP and SC were 97.06\,g/L, 3.24\,g/L{$\cdot$}h and 95.43\%, respectively. Repeated-batch fermentations showed that the ethanol production efficiency of eight successive cycles with and without aeration were not significantly different when the initial sugar of cycles 2 to 8 was under NG conditions ({\textasciitilde}140\,g/L). Positive effects of aeration were observed when the initial sugar from cycle 2 was under HG conditions (180--200\,g/L). The PE and QP under no aeration were consecutively lower from cycle 1 to cycle 6. Additionally, aeration affected ergosterol formation in yeast cell membrane at high ethanol concentrations, whereas trehalose content under all conditions was not different. Conclusion Initial sugar, sufficient nitrogen and appropriated aeration are necessary for promoting yeast growth and ethanol fermentation. The SSJ was successfully used as an ethanol production medium for a high level of ethanol production. Aeration was not essential for repeated-batch fermentation under NG conditions, but it was beneficial under HG conditions. How to cite: Sriputorn B, Laopaiboon P, Phukoetphim N, et al.

  abstract = {Stereolithography (SLA) is a widely used technique for the fabrication of prototypes and small series products. The main advantage of SLA and related solid freeform fabrication (SFF) techniques is their capability to fabricate parts with complex shapes with high resolution. Although the spectrum of available materials has been widened in recent years, there is still a lack of materials which can be processed with SLA on a routine basis. In this work, a micro-SLA ({\textmu}SLA) system is presented which can shape a number of different photopolymers with resolutions down to 5 {\textmu}m in the xy-plane and 10 {\textmu}m in the z-direction. The system is capable of processing various specifically tailored photopolymers which are based on acrylate chemistry. The materials processed for this work range from hybrid sol--gel materials (ORMOCER) to photo-crosslinked elastomers and hydrogels. The elastic moduli of these materials can be tuned over several orders of magnitude and range from 0.1 MPa to 8000 MPa. The reactivity of these monomers is sufficient for achieving writing speeds up to 500 mm s-1 which is comparable to commercial SLA resins. Various test structures are presented which show the suitability of the process for fabricating parts required for applications in micro-mechanical systems as well as for applications in biomedical engineering. Using the presented system, internal channels with a diameter of 50 {\textmu}m and a length of 1500 {\textmu}m could be fabricated. It was also possible to manufacture a micro-mechanical system consisting of a fixed axe and a free spinning turbine wheel.},

  abstract = {The interaction of DNA with various neutral pH, amine-based buffers has been analyzed by free solution capillary electrophoresis, using a mixture of a plasmid-sized DNA molecule and a small DNA oligonucleotide as the reporter system. The two DNAs migrate as separate, nearly Gaussian-shaped peaks in 20--80 mM TAE (TAE, Tris--acetate--EDTA; Tris, tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane) buffer. The separation between the peaks gradually increases with increasing TAE buffer concentration because of differences in solvent friction between large and small DNA molecules. The two DNAs form complexes with the borate ions in TBE (Tris--borate--EDTA) buffer, with mobilities that depend on the DNA/borate ratio. In 45 mM TBE buffer, the two DNAs comigrate as a single sharp peak, with a mobility that is faster than either of the constituent DNAs in the same buffer. Hence, the mixed DNA--borate complex is stabilized by the binding of additional borate ions, possibly forming bridges between the different DNAs. The mixed DNA--borate complex is gradually dissociated into its component DNAs by increasing the TBE concentration, possibly because the borate binding sites become saturated at high buffer concentrations. Other neutral pH, amine-based buffers, such as Mops (3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid), Hepes (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N{$\prime$}-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]), Bes (N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), Tes (N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), and tricine (N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methylglycine) also form complexes with DNA, giving distorted peaks in the electropherograms. The combined results indicate that borate buffers and most neutral pH, amine-based buffers interact with DNA.},

  abstract = {The chapter discusses buffers, its principles, selection, preparation, and practice. It has become important to find buffers to stabilize hydrogen ion concentrations while not interfering with the function of the enzyme being studied. The development of a series of N-substituted taurine and glycine buffers has provided buffers in the physiologically relevant range (6.1--10.4) of most enzymes, which have limited side effects with most enzymes. These buffers are nontoxic to cells at 50 mM concentrations and in some cases much higher. Many factors must be considered while choosing a buffer. When studying an enzyme one must consider the pH optimum of the enzyme, nonspecific buffer effects on the enzyme, and interactions with substrates or metals. Determining the pH optimum of a protein is a first step in determining the best buffer to employ. Volatile buffers are useful in electrophoresis, ion-exchange chromatography, and digestion of proteins followed by separation of peptides or amino acids. There may be occasions where a single buffer system is desired that can span a wide pH range of perhaps 5 or more pH units. One method would be a mixture of buffers that sufficiently covers the pH range of interest. This may lead to nonspecific buffer interactions, for which corrections must be made. Another common approach is to use a series of structurally related buffers that have evenly spaced pK values such that each pK is separated by approximately {\textpm}1 pH unit.}

One of the most important criteria is that the scaffold must be biocompatible. This study was carried out to investigate the potential of HA or TCP/HA scaffold seeded with osteogenic induced sheep marrow cells (SMCs) for bone tissue engineering. Methods: HA-SMC and TCP/HA-SMC constructs were induced in the osteogenic medium for three weeks prior to implantation in nude mice. The HA-SMC and TCP/HA-SMC constructs were implanted subcutaneously on the dorsum of nude mice on each side of the midline. These constructs were harvested after 8 wk of implantation. Constructs before and after implantation were analyzed through histological staining, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and gene expression analysis. Results: The HA-SMC constructs demonstrated minimal bone formation. TCP/HA-SMC construct showed bone formation eight weeks after implantation. The bone formation started on the surface of the ceramic and proceeded to the centre of the pores. H\&E and Alizarin Red staining demonstrated new bone tissue. Gene expression of collagen type 1 increased significantly for both constructs, but more superior for TCP/HA-SMC. SEM results showed the formation of thick collagen fibers encapsulating TCP/HA-SMC more than HA-SMC. Cells attached to both constructs surface proliferated and secreted collagen fibers. Interpretation \& conclusions: The findings suggest that TCP/HA-SMC constructs with better osteogenic potential compared to HA-SMC constructs can be a potential candidate for the formation of tissue engineered bone.},

Current technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors can be considered a solution to provide efficient monitoring of the manufacturing process. In this study, a real-time monitoring system that utilizes IoT-based sensors, big data processing, and a hybrid prediction model is proposed. Firstly, an IoT-based sensor that collects temperature, humidity, accelerometer, and gyroscope data was developed. The characteristics of IoT-generated sensor data from the manufacturing process are: real-time, large amounts, and unstructured type. The proposed big data processing platform utilizes Apache Kafka as a message queue, Apache Storm as a real-time processing engine and MongoDB to store the sensor data from the manufacturing process. Secondly, for the proposed hybrid prediction model, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection and Random Forest classification were used to remove outlier sensor data and provide fault detection during the manufacturing process, respectively. The proposed model was evaluated and tested at an automotive manufacturing assembly line in Korea. The results showed that IoT-based sensors and the proposed big data processing system are sufficiently efficient to monitor the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid prediction model has better fault prediction accuracy than other models given the sensor data as input. The proposed system is expected to support management by improving decision-making and will help prevent unexpected losses caused by faults during the manufacturing process.},

  abstract = {ConspectusNucleic acids typically form a double helix structure through Watson--Crick base-pairing. In contrast, non-Watson--Crick base pairs can form other three-dimensional structures. Although it is well-known that Watson--Crick base pairs may be more unstable than non-Watson--Crick base pairs under some conditions, the importance of non-Watson--Crick base pairs has not been widely examined. Hoogsteen base pairs, the non-Watson--Crick base pairs, contain important hydrogen-bond patterns that form the helices of nucleic acids, such as in Watson--Crick base pairs, and can form non-double helix structures such as triplexes and quadruplexes. In recent years, non-double helix structures have been discovered in cells and were reported to considerably influence gene expression. The complex behavior of these nucleic acids in cells is gradually being revealed, but the underlying mechanisms remain almost unknown.Quantitatively analyzing the structural stability of nucleic acids is important for understanding their behavior. A nucleic acid is an anionic biopolymer composed of a sugar, base, and phosphoric acid. The physicochemical factors that determine the stability of nucleic acid structures include those derived from the interactions of nucleic acid structures and those derived from the environments surrounding nucleic acids. The Gibbs free energy change ({$\Delta$}G) of structure formation is the most commonly used physicochemical parameter for analyzing quantitative stability. Quantitatively understanding the intracellular behavior of nucleic acids involves describing the formation of nucleic acid structures and related reactions as {$\Delta$}G. Based on this concept, we quantitatively analyzed the stability of double helix and non-double helix structures and found that decreased water activity, an important factor in crowded cellular conditions, significantly destabilize the formation of Watson--Crick base pairs but stabilizes Hoogsteen base pairs.Here, we describe a physicochemical approach to understand the regulation of gene expressions based on the stability of nucleic acid structures. We developed new methods for predicting the stability of double and non-double helices in various molecular environments by mimicking intracellular environments. Furthermore, the physicochemical approach used for analyzing gene expression regulated by non-double helix structures is useful for not only determining how gene expression is controlled by cellular environments but also for developing new technologies to chemically regulate gene expression by targeting non-double helix structures. We discuss the roles of Watson--Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs in cells based on our results and why both types of base pairing are required for life. Finally, a new concept in nucleic acid science beyond that of Watson and Crick base pairing is introduced.},

  abstract = {The kernel of industrial advanced process control (APC) lies in the formulation and solution of model predictive control (MPC) problems, which specify the controller moves according to the solution of an optimal control problem at each sampling time. A significant challenge is the online computation for large-scale industrial systems. As the state-of-the-art APC technology, the Shell--Yokogawa Platform for Advanced Control and Estimation (PACE) has adopted a systematic framework of handling dynamic optimization of large-scale systems, where an automatic decomposition procedure generates subsystems for distributed MPC. The decomposition is implemented on network representations of the MPC models that capture interactions among process variables, with community detection used to maximize the statistical significance of the subnetworks with preferred internal interconnections. This paper introduces the fundamentals of such a decomposition approach and this functionality in PACE, followed by a case study on a crude distillation process to showcase its industrial application.},

Although the EU-Nigeria e-waste trade is illegal under EU and Nigerian law, previous research shows that some imported equipment is only fit for disposal. Imported UEEE has a short lifespan. Such European e-waste exports imported to Nigeria have sustainability and circularity implications for both places and raise questions about justice and equity. Using a transdisciplinary approach, we identify existing practices and challenges in Nigeria and co-create actionable solutions towards a sustainable, circular and fairness-driven UEEE and e-waste value chain. We find current extended producer responsibility (EPR) does not focus on the entire global value chain, is linear, and lacks transparency, accountability, and consideration for spatial equity. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose ultimate producer responsibility (UPR). UPR aids sustainability and circularity transition while paying attention to justice and equity. The research adds global and social dimensions to the European circular economy (CE), otherwise primarily focused on national material cycles.},

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) in water was found to be 0.0085 mol L-1 at 303.15 K. The concentration of SDS in pre-micellar and post-micellar regions of 0.005 and 0.01 M was used for the thermodynamic measurements. Free energy ({$\Delta$}G\#), increases rapidly with alcohol concentration and shows maxima in aqueous SDS rich region at 0.2--0.3 mol fraction of alcohols. The position of maxima virtually does not change remarkably with the variation of temperature. The excess free energy, ({$\Delta$}G\#E) values are found to be positive and large in magnitude, indicating that the aqueous SDS solutions of alcohols are highly non ideal. The heights of the maxima are in the order: iso-Propanol + aqueous SDS {$>$} n-Propanol + aqueous SDS {$>$} Ethanol + aqueous SDS {$>$} Methanol + aqueous SDS. The {$\Delta$}H\# values that are positive for all the studied systems indicate that positive work has to be done to overcome the energy barrier for the flow process. The variation of {$\Delta$}S\# is reversing the variation of the {$\Delta$}H\#. The excess parameters ({$\Delta$}G\#E, {$\Delta$}H\#E) data have been fitted by the least square method to the four parameter Redlich--Kister equation and the values of the parameter aj have been reported. The observed increase of thermodynamic values in the aqueous SDS region are thought to be mainly due to the combined effect of hydrophobic hydration and hydrophilic effect.},

This paper explores the utilization of freeze casting (FC) as a technique to generate composite scaffolds comprising hydroxyapatite (HA) reinforced with 1D-boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) featuring graded porosity and improved compressive strength. Comparative studies were conducted using FC at room and sub-zero temperatures to assess the influence of temperature gradient and heat transfer rate on the production of gradient and aligned porosity in HA-BNNT composites. The FC process with a prolonged thermal gradient facilitated the creation of aligned pores in the HA-BNNT, exhibiting a wide distribution of 60\% porosity ranging from 1 to 30~{$\mu$}m. Adding high strength 1~vol\% BNNT reinforcement resulted in a remarkable 50\% enhancement in compressive strength compared to the control sample. Osteoblasts seeded on the HA-BNNT substrate exhibited significantly higher alkaline phosphate activity, indicating accelerated mineralization compared to the control sample. Gradient porosity and wide pore distribution in the HA-BNNT scaffolds promoted osteogenic activities. Overall, the demonstrated FC processing technique and BNNT addition hold great potential for developing functional and biomimetic scaffolds that can effectively promote tissue regeneration, leading to improved clinical outcomes in bone tissue engineering applications.},

  abstract = {Near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements for bioprocess monitoring and control, are integral to process analytical technology (PAT) initiatives by EMEA and US-FDA. Yet, NIRS is not widely practiced in challenging microbial fermentation processes. We present a practical approach to develop NIRS models for linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA) and ammonia which are critical nutrients in lipstatin fermentation by Streptomyces toxitricini. The lipstatin productivity was enhanced and steadied by dynamic monitoring and control of critical nutrient ratio (CNR) of LA to ammonia. The NIRS models were used to develop a novel, soft probe for CNR as an alternative to laborious, hourly, off-line analyses. The calibration was designed with typical data for four industrially useful microbes. The approach enabled direct use of spectra for a generally applicable model with distinct wave number optima of 6250--5555cm-1 (LA), 6666--5882cm-1 (OA), 6800--6300cm-1 (ammonia). The standard errors of calibration and prediction were 1.5{\texttimes}10-3gL-1, 1.6{\texttimes}10-3gL-1, 1.1ppm, and 8.9{\texttimes}10-4gL-1, 1.8{\texttimes}10-2gL-1, 3.6ppm, respectively, for the respective nutrients. The robustness of probe is evident from the low mean percentage error of 2.3\% for prediction of CNR at low concentration ranges of 0.02--0.24gL-1 and 0.21--0.56gg-1 for LA and CNR, respectively.},

  abstract = {The Gram staining is one of the most crucial staining techniques in microbiology. It gets its name from the Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram who first introduced it in 1882, mainly to identify organisms causing pneumonia.~Often the first test performed, gram staining involves the use of crystal violet or methylene blue as the primary color.~The term for organisms that retain the primary color and appear purple-brown under a microscope is Gram-positive organisms. The organisms that do not take up primary stain appear red under a microscope and are Gram-negative organisms. ~The first step in gram staining is the use of crystal violet dye for the slide's initial staining. The next step, also known as fixing the dye, involves using iodine to form crystal violet- iodine complex to prevent easy removal of dye. Subsequently, a decolorizer, often solvent of ethanol and acetone, is used to remove the dye. The basic principle of gram staining involves the ability of the bacterial cell wall to retain the crystal violet dye during solvent treatment.~Gram-positive microorganisms have higher peptidoglycan content, whereas gram-negative organisms have higher lipid content.~ Initially, all bacteria take up crystal violet dye; however, with the use of solvent, the lipid layer from gram-negative organisms is dissolved. With the dissolution of the lipid layer, gram negatives lose the primary stain. In contrast, solvent dehydrates the gram-positive cell walls with the closure of pores preventing diffusion of violet-iodine complex, and thus, bacteria remain stained.~The length of decolorization is a critical step in gram staining as prolonged exposure to a decolorizing agent can remove all the stains from both types of bacteria. The final step in gram staining is to use basic fuchsin stain to give decolorized gram-negative bacteria pink color for easier identification. It is also known as counterstain. Some laboratories use safranin as a counterstain; however, basic fuchsin stains gram-negative organisms more intensely than safranin. Similarly, Hemophilus spp., Legionella app, and some anaerobic bacteria stain poorly with safranin.},

  abstract = {The tracking of electronic waste (e-waste) flows through and within pre-processing facilities plays a crucial role in determining the fate of resources contained in e-waste. This study maps material and economic flows of e-waste through manual and mechanical processes at the pre-processing facility using material flow analysis. Both daily and annual material flows were accounted for, and daily flow outputs were also translated into economic flows. Each day the facility mainly processed printers and peripheral devices, laser cartridges, and refurbishable flatscreen displays. The main material outputs were glass, mixed plastics, and computer and communication wires containing copper. The most valuable products were refurbished goods and the highest revenue material was copper, whereas the highest cost item was glass from cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, due to its lead content. From 2016--2018 the facility received fewer CRT displays due to both global e-waste trends, by selling and trading CRTs to other Ontario pre-processors in exchange for flatscreen displays. This approach helped the facility to capitalize new specialized equipment for the processing of flat screens and reduced downstream leaded glass processing costs. The changing product and material profile of e-waste in Canada, and globally, needs advanced technological solutions by the pre-processors to maximize resource recovery in economically feasible manner.},

However, the characteristics of microarray gene expression data consist of a huge number of features for a reduced number of samples. DNA microarrays are one of the most commonly used technologies for gene expression measurement and there are several distinct microarray platforms from different manufacturers, each with its own measurement protocol, resulting in data that can hardly be compared or directly integrated. Data integration from multiple sources aims to improve the assertiveness of statistical tests and predictive modeling, reducing the data dimensionality problem. This integration increases the number of available samples, empowering the results of gene expression analysis, such as the identification of valuable biomarkers. This article addresses the integration of gene expression data from heterogeneous platforms, a problem with multiple layers of complexity. The principles of gene expression and microarray measurement will be explained, and the challenges encountered when trying to perform gene expression data integration will be addressed, mentioning previous studies that have tried to overcome them.},

  abstract = {Plant science uses increasing amounts of phenotypic data to unravel the complex interactions between biological systems and their variable environments. Originally, phenotyping approaches were limited by manual, often destructive operations, causing large errors. Plant imaging emerged as a viable alternative allowing non-invasive and automated data acquisition. Several procedures based on image analysis were developed to monitor leaf growth as a major phenotyping target. However, in most proposals, a time-consuming parameterization of the analysis pipeline is required to handle variable conditions between images, particularly in the field due to unstable light and interferences with soil surface or weeds. To cope with these difficulties, we developed a low-cost, 2D imaging method, hereafter called PYM. The method is based on plant leaf ability to absorb blue light while reflecting infrared wavelengths. PYM consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with an infrared camera and a blue filter and is associated with scripts that compute projected leaf area. This new method was tested on diverse species placed in contrasting conditions. Application to field conditions was evaluated on lettuces grown under photovoltaic panels. The objective was to look for possible acclimation of leaf expansion under photovoltaic panels to optimise the use of solar radiation per unit soil area.},

  abstract = {Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has become increasingly important over the last years. Additionally, the European Union recognizes the growing importance of raw materials, and the crucial role of recycling. In this study the performance of WEEE recycling was assessed for the case of desktop and laptop computers in Belgium in 2013. The analysis was performed in four steps. First, the recycling chain is analyzed through material flow analysis (MFA) at the level of specific materials. Second, an indicator is calculated, which quantifies the effectively recycled weight ratios of the specific materials. Third, a second indicator expresses the recycling efficiency of so-called critical raw materials. Finally, the natural resource consumption of the recycling scheme in a life cycle perspective is calculated using the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE) method, and is benchmarked with a landfill scenario. Overall, the results show that base metals such as ferrous metals, aluminium and copper are recycled to a large extent, but that for precious metals improvements still can be made. The input of criticality (arising from the incoming mass, as well as the individual criticality value of the assessed material) mainly comes from base metals, resulting in a high recovery performance of raw materials criticality. Finally, the natural resource consumption of the recycling scenario is much smaller than in case of landfilling the WEEE: 80 and 87\% less resource consumption is achieved for desktops and laptops respectively, hence saving significant primary raw materials.},

Flux balance methods only require information about metabolic reaction stoichiometry, metabolic requirements for growth, and the measurement of a few strain--specific parameters. This information determines the domain of stoichiometrically allowable flux distributions that may be taken to define a strain's ``metabolic genotype''. Within this domain a single flux distribution is sought based on assumed behavior, such as maximal growth rates. The optimal flux distributions are calculated using linear optimization and may be taken to represent the strain's ``metabolic phenotype'' under the particular conditions. This flux balance methodology allows the quantitative interpretation of metabolic physiology, gives an interpretation of experimental data, provides a guide to metabolic engineering, enables optimal medium formulation, and provides a method for bioprocess optimization. This spectrum of applications, and its ease of use, makes the metabolic flux balance model a potentially valuable approach for the design and optimization of bioprocesses.},

Efficient process control allows quality of the product to be maintained, but also reduces costs, increases profit, and reduces pollution of the environment. Real-time process monitoring is fundamental for good process control. Rapid development of bioprocess applications led to intensive search for new sensors able to provide real-time information about the process. Real-time sensors may operate in an in situ (in-line) and ex situ on-line set-up. This work reviews the approaches that have been used for bioprocess monitoring and is divided in two parts. First part deals with in situ methods with sensors placed inside the reactor and in direct contact with bulk medium. Second part discusses sample handling techniques (e.g. FIA and SIA) that allow sample withdrawal from the reactor and automatic handling, transport to the sensor, and ex situ, on-line monitoring.},

  abstract = {To improve the yield of industrial fermentation, herein, we report a method based on Fourier-transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) to predict the growth of yeast. First, the spectra were obtained using an FT-NIR spectrometer during the process of yeast cultivation. Each spectrum was acquired over the range from 10 000 to 4000 cm-1, which resulted in spectra with 1557 variables. Moreover, the optical density (OD) value of each fermentation sample was determined via photoelectric turbidity method. Then, using a method based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), characteristic wavelength variables were selected from the preprocessed spectral data. Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) algorithm was employed to develop the prediction model for the determination of OD. The results of the model based on GMR were achieved as follows: only 13 characteristic wavelength variables were selected by CRAS, the coefficient of determination Rp2 was 0.98842, and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.07262 in the validation set. Finally, compared to kernel partial least squares regression (KPLS), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) models, GMR model showed excellent performance for prediction and generalization. This study demonstrated that FT-NIR spectroscopy analysis technology integrated with appropriate chemometric approaches could be utilized to monitor the growth process of yeast, and GMR revealed its superiority in model calibration.},

Often, hypertonic injectables may have to be marketed for a variety of reasons such as product solubilization and stabilization. A key concern during product formulation development is the local and systemic tolerability of hypertonic products upon injection. This report reviews and discusses the tolerability in terms of local discomfort, irritation, sensation of heat and pain, along with other observed side effects of hypertonicity in both in-vitro systems and in-vivo animal and human models. These side effects clearly depend on the degree of hypertonicity. The sensation of pain among different injection routes seems to follow this order: intramuscular{$>$}subcutaneous{$>$}intravenous or intravascular. It is recommended that the upper osmolality limit should be generally controlled under 600mOsm/kg for drug products intended for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. For drug products intended for intravenous or intravascular injection, the recommended upper limit should be generally controlled under 1000mOsm/kg for small-volume injections ({$\leq$}100mL) and 500mOsm/kg for large-volume injections ({$>$}100mL). Several options are available for minimization of hypertonicity-induced pain upon product administration.},

  abstract = {In Microbiology it is often assumed that growth rate is maximal. This may be taken to suggest that the dependence of the growth rate on every enzyme activity is at the top of an inverse-parabolic function, i.e. that all flux control coefficients should equal zero. This might seem to imply that the sum of these flux control coefficients equals zero. According to the summation law of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) the sum of flux control coefficients should equal 1 however. And in Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) catabolism is often limited by a hard bound, causing catabolism to fully control the fluxes, again in apparent contrast with a flux control coefficient of zero. Here we resolve these paradoxes (apparent contradictions) in an analysis that uses the `Edinburgh pathway', the `Amsterdam pathway', as well as a generic metabolic network providing the building blocks or Gibbs energy for microbial growth. We review and show that (i) optimization depends on so-called enzyme control coefficients rather than the `catalytic control coefficients' of MCA's summation law, (ii) when optimization occurs at fixed total protein, the former differ from the latter to the extent that they may all become equal to zero in the optimum state, (iii) in more realistic scenarios of optimization where catalytically inert biomass is compensating or maintenance metabolism is taken into consideration, the optimum enzyme concentrations should not be expected to equal those that maximize the specific growth rate, (iv) optimization may be in terms of yield rather than specific growth rate, which resolves the paradox because the sum of catalytic control coefficients on yield equals 0, (v) FBA effectively maximizes growth yield, and for yield the summation law states 0 rather than 1, thereby removing the paradox, (vi) furthermore, FBA then comes more often to a `hard optimum' defined by a maximum catabolic flux and a catabolic-enzyme control coefficient of 1. The trade-off between maintenance metabolism and growth is highlighted as worthy of further analysis.},

Different types of molecular descriptors are important, like lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding for the passive transcelullar permeability or pharmacophores or ligand--protein interaction for drug metabolism. Descriptors used for ADME modeling need to explain the relevant properties such as size, lipophilic and hydrophilic profiles, hydrogen bond patterns, pharmacophores, and ligand--protein interaction. In this chapter we give an overview on available descriptors for each of these properties and add information about various descriptor sets that have been used in ADME-modeling. We also discuss the importance of the knowledge about the property that is to be modeled in order to be able to interpret the results properly. Furthermore, the scope of the analysis is important: local models could use descriptors developed for a particular series of compounds. Moreover, these descriptors should be easy to interpret in order to suggest chemical changes in a molecule to obtain the desired ADME property or in the understanding of the complex of ADME data. Global models make use of descriptors that should be able to be computed easily for a large and diverse set of compounds, and they are mainly used in the drug discovery process to filter out compounds and select those with the appropriate properties.},

Research in clinical pharmacology should therefore address three fundamental questions: (1) What is the magnitude of drug effects (beneficial or adverse) from a given dose? (2) How quickly will any given effects occur? (3) How long will these effects last? Under steady-state conditions, only the magnitude of drug effects can be examined. This requires researchers to consider non-steady-state conditions, which require more complex models and an understanding of the mechanisms that drive the time course of drug effect. The aim of this review is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding the time course of drug effects using pharmacokinetic--pharmacodynamic models. Key examples will illustrate how this can inform the optimal use of drugs in the clinic.},

M1 macrophages target cancerous cells and, therefore, can be used as drug carriers for tumor therapy. Herein, the strategies to engineer macrophages for cancer immunotherapy, such as inhibition of macrophage recruitment, depletion of TAMs, reprograming of TAMs, and blocking of the CD47-SIRP{$\alpha$} pathway, are discussed. Further, the recent advances in drug delivery using M1 macrophages, macrophage-derived exosomes, and macrophage-membrane-coated nanoparticles are elaborated. Overall, there is still significant room for development in macrophage-mediated immune modulation and macrophage-mediated drug delivery, which will further enhance current tumor therapies against various malignant solid tumors, including drug-resistant tumors and metastatic tumors.},

However, due to a lack of systematical evaluation of HAp and TCP composite scaffolds for bone repair, their distinctions on bone regeneration in vivo have not been clearly clarified to date. In this study, we constructed HAp and TCP composite poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds with the same contents of HAp and TCP and similar structures and porosities, and systematically investigated their performance in the repair of rabbits' calvarial bone defects. The HAp/PLGA scaffold possessed stronger mechanical property and higher cell proliferation than the TCP/PLGA scaffold, endowing it with better performance of bone regeneration at an early stage. Since TCP could greatly neutralize degraded acidic products and be slowly absorbed in vivo to release occupied room for new bone growth compared to HAp, the TCP/PLGA scaffold yielded more intact new bone for long-term repair of the defects. Our results clearly demonstrate that TCP is a superior bioceramic for bone tissue engineering, showing promise for the perfect repair of bone defects via tissue engineering.},

  abstract = {Oral administration is the most commonly used and readily accepted form of drug delivery; however, it is find that many drugs are difficult to attain enough bioavailability when administered via this route. Polymeric micelles (PMs) can overcome some limitations of the oral delivery acting as carriers able to enhance drug absorption, by providing (1) protection of the loaded drug from the harsh environment of the GI tract, (2) release of the drug in a controlled manner at target sites, (3) prolongation of the residence time in the gut by mucoadhesion, and (4) inhibition of efflux pumps to improve the drug accumulation. To explain the mechanisms for enhancement of oral bioavailability, we discussed the special stability of PMs, the controlled release properties of pH-sensitive PMs, the prolongation of residence time with mucoadhesive PMs, and the P-gp inhibitors commonly used in PMs, respectively. The primary purpose of this paper is to illustrate the potential of PMs for delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs with bioavailability being well maintained.},

  abstract = {The ability to efficiently access cytosolic proteins is desired in both biological research and medicine. However, targeting intracellular proteins is often challenging, because to reach the cytosol, exogenous molecules must first traverse the cell membrane. This review provides a broad overview of how certain molecules are thought to cross this barrier, and what kinds of approaches are being made to enhance the intracellular delivery of those that are impermeable. We first discuss rules that govern the passive permeability of small molecules across the lipid membrane, and mechanisms of membrane transport that have evolved in nature for certain metabolites, peptides, and proteins. Then, we introduce design strategies that have emerged in the development of small molecules and peptides with improved permeability. Finally, intracellular delivery systems that have been engineered for protein payloads are surveyed. Viewpoints from varying disciplines have been brought together to provide a cohesive overview of how the membrane barrier is being overcome.},

  abstract = {The diverse matrices pose great challenges for rapid detection of low Salmonella level ({$<$}10~CFU) in fresh produce. The applicability of microarray-based PathogenDx system for detecting low contamination of Salmonella Newport from leafy greens was evaluated. A pre-PCR preparation protocol including enrichment in universal pre-enrichment broth for 3~h followed by sample concentration using an InnovaPrep bio-concentrator or 6~h enrichment without a concentration step was used for detecting S. Newport from leafy greens with initial inoculum level at {$\sim$}6~CFU/25~g. Among 205 samples tested, 98\%, 93\%, 76\%, and 60\% of Romaine lettuce, Iceberg lettuce, kale, and spinach samples were tested positive after 3~h of enrichment with sample concentration. After 6~h of enrichment, 100\%, 98\%, 90\%, and 82\% of Romaine lettuce, Iceberg lettuce, kale, and spinach samples were positive. The samples were parallelly tested by the FDA bacterial analytical manual (BAM) method and 100\% of spiked produce samples were tested positive. The overall analysis time of this methodology was between 8 and 11~h, including all pre-enrichment and concentration steps, in contrast to 4--5 days required for BAM method. The system correctly differentiated all 108 Salmonella strains and 35 non-Salmonella strains used in the study. This novel microarray approach provides a rapid method for detecting Salmonella in leafy greens.},

Molecular genetic manipulation of bacteria requires the development of plasmid-mediated transformation systems that include (1) chemical transformation, (2) electro-transformation, (3) biolistic transformation, and (4) sonic transformation, leading to the introduction of exogenous plasmid DNA into bacterial cells. In this review, the manipulation properties and transformation efficiencies of these techniques are described. In addition to these methods, a conceptually novel transformation technique, namely the hydrogel exposure method, was developed. The hydrogel exposure method, based on the Yoshida effect, provides a significant advance over chemical means for transforming many strains of Escherichia coli and a variety of other bacterial species. The new term ``tribos transformation'' has been proposed for this novel technique. We also determined that, compared to conventional methods, the hydrogel exposure method is a novel and convenient method by which to transform bacteria.},

  abstract = {Foodborne outbreaks are a serious public health and food safety concern worldwide. There is a great demand for rapid, sensitive, specific, and accurate methods to detect microbial pathogens in foods. Conventional methods based on cultivation of pathogens have been the gold standard protocols; however, they take up to a week to complete. Molecular assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequencing, microarray technologies have been widely used in detection of foodborne pathogens. Among molecular assays, PCR technology [conventional and real-time PCR (qPCR)] is most commonly used in the foodborne pathogen detection because of its high sensitivity and specificity. However, a major drawback of PCR is its inability to differentiate the DNA from dead and viable cells, and this is a critical factor for the food industry, regulatory agencies and the consumer. To remedy this shortcoming, researchers have used biological dyes such as ethidium monoazide and propidium monoazide (PMA) to pretreat samples before DNA extraction to intercalate the DNA of dead cells in food samples, and then proceed with regular DNA preparation and qPCR. By combining PMA treatment with qPCR (PMA-qPCR), scientists have applied this technology to detect viable cells of various bacterial pathogens in foods. The incorporation of PMA into PCR-based assays for viability detection of pathogens in foods has increased significantly in the last decade. On the other hand, some downsides with this approach have been noted, particularly to achieve complete suppression of signal of DNA from the dead cells present in some particular food matrix. Nowadays, there is a tendency of more and more researchers adapting this approach for viability detection; and a few commercial kits based on PMA are available in the market. As time goes on, more scientists apply this approach to a broader range of pathogen detections, this viability approach (PMA or other chemicals such as platinum compound) may eventually become a common methodology for the rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of foodborne pathogens. In this review, we summarize the development in the field including progress and challenges and give our perspective in this area.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytotoxicity in cell culture is typically expressed as LC50 the concentration of a given agent which is lethal to 50\% of the cells. This number is dependent on the incubation time with the agent. Previously, a two-term exponential model has been proposed to describe cell growth after a cytotoxic event: y(t) = k, * exp(-d(1)*t) + k2 * exp(d(2)*t). A dose-response relationship was observed between the parameter k2 in this formula and the concentration of the cytotoxic agent etoposide, in high-grade glioma cells was independent of incubation time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to test if the model can be applied more generally, DAOY medulloblastoma cells treated with MS275, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, were used. RESULTS: The observed data fit the model well. CONCLUSION: The concentration at which k2 is reduced by 50\% is called KC50. It provides a far better description of the cytotoxicity of an agent in a specific cell line than the traditional LC50.},

  abstract = {Quality identification of multi-component mixtures is essential for production process control. Artificial sensory evaluation is a conventional quality evaluation method of multi-component mixture, which is easily affected by human subjective factors, and its results are inaccurate and unstable. This study developed a near-infrared (NIR) spectral characteristic extraction method based on a three-dimensional analysis space and establishes a high-accuracy qualitative identification model. First, the Norris derivative filtering algorithm was used in the pre-processing of the NIR spectrum to obtain a smooth main absorption peak. Then, the third-order tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) algorithm was used for characteristic extraction, which effectively reduced the dimensionality of the raw NIR spectral data. Finally, on this basis, a qualitative identification model based on support vector machines (SVM) was constructed, and the classification accuracy reached 98.94\%. Therefore, it is possible to develop a non-destructive, rapid qualitative detection system based on NIR spectroscopy to mine the subtle differences between classes and to use low-dimensional characteristic wavebands to detect the quality of complex multi-component mixtures. This method can be a key component of automatic quality control in the production of multi-component products.},

Myoglobin, equine cytochrome c, bovine cytochrome c and carbonic anhydrase II solutions were subjected to electroosmosis in a theta tip and all of the proteins were denatured during the process. The extent of protein denaturation was found to increase with the applied square wave voltage and electrolyte concentration. The solution temperature at the end of a theta tip was measured directly by Raman spectroscopy and shown to increase with the square wave voltage, thereby demonstrating the effect of Joule heating through an independent method. The electroosmosis of a solution comprised of myoglobin, bovine cytochrome c, and ubiquitin demonstrated that the magnitude of Joule heating that causes protein denaturation is positively correlated with protein melting temperature. This allows for a quick determination of a protein's relative thermal stability. This work establishes a fast, novel method for protein conformation manipulation prior to MS analysis and provides a temperature-controllable platform for the study of processes that take place in solution with direct coupling to mass spectrometry.,},

  abstract = {The ascospores of resistant fungi, Neosartorya fischeri, can survive commercial pasteurization, diminishing the shelf life of these products. The time that the ascospores remain in the environment and the effect that they can cause on mold growth are still unknown. This study is aimed to evaluate the influence of water activity (aw) from 0.90 to 0.99 and the ascospore age (I) from 30 to 90 days of vitro incubation on the growth of N. fischeri in pineapple juice by mathematical modeling. The growth parameters on pineapple juice: adaptation phase (l), maximum specific growth rate (mmax) and maximum diameter reached by the colony (A) were obtained by fitting Modified Gompertz and Logistic models to the experimental data. Both models were able to describe microbial growth in pineapple juice, but the Modified Gompertz model presented a slightly superior performance based on statistical indices (correlation coefficients (R2), mean square error (MSE), Bias Factor and Accuracy Factor). The minimum values of l and A, calculated by the Modified Gompertz model, were 64.7 h and 6.3 mm, while the maximum values were 178.2 h and 20.8 mm, respectively. The result showed that ascospore age did not influence the growth but aw was statistically significant to the growth parameters l and A.},
