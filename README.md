## Purpose

Implement  NIR spectroscopy and machine learning for the detection and real-time analysis of media within cultures for continuous quality testing

## Overview

### Data Collection

### Training Data

#### Data Augmentation

Due to the limited time that was available for data collection, the datasets for each scan were augmented based temporal subsampling. This allowed a larger training dataset based on limited collection time. While not optimal, it should still allow for proof of concept.
