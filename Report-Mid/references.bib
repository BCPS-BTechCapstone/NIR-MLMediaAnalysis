  abstract = {This work investigates the capability of Fourier-Transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy to monitor and assess process parameters in beer fermentation at different operative conditions. For this purpose, the fermentation of wort with two different yeast strains and at different temperatures was monitored for nine days by FT-NIR. To correlate the collected spectra with {$^\circ$}Brix, pH and biomass, different multivariate data methodologies were applied. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS) and locally weighted regression (LWR) were used to assess the relationship between FT-NIR spectra and the abovementioned process parameters that define the beer fermentation. The accuracy and robustness of the obtained results clearly show the suitability of FT-NIR spectroscopy, combined with multivariate data analysis, to be used as a quality control tool in the beer fermentation process. FT-NIR spectroscopy, when combined with LWR, demonstrates to be a perfectly suitable quantitative method to be implemented in the production of beer.},

Experiment 1 In 5 healthy volunteers, we measured the oxy-Hb and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) concentrations during 11 kinds of facial, head, and extremity movements. The probes were set in the bilateral frontal regions. The deoxy-Hb concentration was increased in 85\% of the measurements. Experiment 2 Using a pillow on the backrest of the chair, we established the video-NIRS system with data acquisition and video capture software. One hundred and seventy-six elderly people performed the WF task. The deoxy-Hb concentration was decreased in 167 subjects (95\%). Experiment 3 Using the video-NIRS system, we measured the {$\Delta$}oxy-Hb, and compared it with the results of the WF task. {$\Delta$}oxy-Hb was significantly correlated with the number of words. Conclusion Like the blood oxygen level-dependent imaging effect in functional MRI, the deoxy-Hb concentration will decrease if the data correctly reflect the change in neural activity. The video-NIRS system might be useful to collect NIRS data by recording the waveforms and the subject's appearance simultaneously.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion is a method used to recover subsurface parameters, and it requires heavy computational resources. We present a cyclic shot subsampling method to make the full waveform inversion efficient while maintaining the quality of the inversion results. The cyclic method subsamples the shots at a regular interval and changes the shot subset at each iteration step. Using this method, we can suppress the aliasing noise present in regular-interval subsampling. We compared the cyclic method with divide-and-conquer, random, and random-in-each-subgroup subsampling methods using the Laplace-domain full waveform inversion. We found examples of a 2D marine field data set from the Gulf of Mexico and a 3D synthetic salt velocity model. In the inversion examples using the subsampling methods, we could reduce the computation time and obtain results comparable to that without a subsampling technique. The cyclic method and two random subsampling methods yielded similar results; however, the cyclic method generated the best results, especially when the number of shot subsamples was small, as expected. We also examined the effect of subsample updating frequency. The updating frequency does not have a significant effect on the results when the number of subsamples is large. In contrast, frequent subsample updating becomes important when the number of subsamples is small. The random-in-each-subgroup scheme showed the best results if we did not update the subsamples frequently, while the cyclic method suffers from aliasing. The results suggested that the cyclic subsampling scheme can be an alternative to the random schemes and the distributed subsampling schemes with a frequently changing subset are better than lumped subsampling schemes.},

  abstract = {Quality identification of multi-component mixtures is essential for production process control. Artificial sensory evaluation is a conventional quality evaluation method of multi-component mixture, which is easily affected by human subjective factors, and its results are inaccurate and unstable. This study developed a near-infrared (NIR) spectral characteristic extraction method based on a three-dimensional analysis space and establishes a high-accuracy qualitative identification model. First, the Norris derivative filtering algorithm was used in the pre-processing of the NIR spectrum to obtain a smooth main absorption peak. Then, the third-order tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) algorithm was used for characteristic extraction, which effectively reduced the dimensionality of the raw NIR spectral data. Finally, on this basis, a qualitative identification model based on support vector machines (SVM) was constructed, and the classification accuracy reached 98.94\%. Therefore, it is possible to develop a non-destructive, rapid qualitative detection system based on NIR spectroscopy to mine the subtle differences between classes and to use low-dimensional characteristic wavebands to detect the quality of complex multi-component mixtures. This method can be a key component of automatic quality control in the production of multi-component products.},

Samples taken from a three-day fibroblast culture were analyzed with standard clinical chemistry techniques and with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The data were analyzed in three phases in an attempt to solve problems of correlation in the data. First, partial least-squares regression was used to build a multivariate calibration model based on the near-infrared spectra of the cell culture media and measured reference values. Second, an independent calibration was performed with aqueous mixtures of glucose, lactate, ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine. Finally, a calibration using a combination of spectra from cell culture media samples and aqueous mixtures was performed. In each case, the spectral loadings obtained from the calibration were inspected to determine the extent of weighting given to different spectral regions. The results indicate that a selective calibration model can be produced by combining data from samples of different type. Prediction errors of 2, 8, and 15\% were obtained for glucose, lactate, and ammonia, respectively.},

This is of central importance in Process Analytical Chemistry (PAC) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT). The incitement to this study was the observation of spectral artifacts during measurements of powder samples in process streams when using a mechanically scanning spectrometer. Artifacts appeared as momentary changes in the spectral response during acquisition of a scan. These transitions emanate from continuous replacement of the sample subfraction seen by the probe and are typical for turbid media where sample properties may vary locally with respect to scattering and/or absorption. The impact on qualitative and quantitative analysis using chemometric methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression was evaluated through experimental and theoretical simulations. It was generally found that spectra with the smallest residuals after projection onto the models came from non-moving samples or samples moving only slowly. It is shown that the magnitude of the spectral residuals is directly connected to the effective sample size, which relates both to sample speed as well as to the sample area presented to the probe. Implications for in-line/on-line process analysis of solids are discussed.},

  abstract = {Plant science uses increasing amounts of phenotypic data to unravel the complex interactions between biological systems and their variable environments. Originally, phenotyping approaches were limited by manual, often destructive operations, causing large errors. Plant imaging emerged as a viable alternative allowing non-invasive and automated data acquisition. Several procedures based on image analysis were developed to monitor leaf growth as a major phenotyping target. However, in most proposals, a time-consuming parameterization of the analysis pipeline is required to handle variable conditions between images, particularly in the field due to unstable light and interferences with soil surface or weeds. To cope with these difficulties, we developed a low-cost, 2D imaging method, hereafter called PYM. The method is based on plant leaf ability to absorb blue light while reflecting infrared wavelengths. PYM consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with an infrared camera and a blue filter and is associated with scripts that compute projected leaf area. This new method was tested on diverse species placed in contrasting conditions. Application to field conditions was evaluated on lettuces grown under photovoltaic panels. The objective was to look for possible acclimation of leaf expansion under photovoltaic panels to optimise the use of solar radiation per unit soil area.},

  abstract = {To improve the yield of industrial fermentation, herein, we report a method based on Fourier-transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) to predict the growth of yeast. First, the spectra were obtained using an FT-NIR spectrometer during the process of yeast cultivation. Each spectrum was acquired over the range from 10 000 to 4000 cm-1, which resulted in spectra with 1557 variables. Moreover, the optical density (OD) value of each fermentation sample was determined via photoelectric turbidity method. Then, using a method based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), characteristic wavelength variables were selected from the preprocessed spectral data. Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) algorithm was employed to develop the prediction model for the determination of OD. The results of the model based on GMR were achieved as follows: only 13 characteristic wavelength variables were selected by CRAS, the coefficient of determination Rp2 was 0.98842, and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.07262 in the validation set. Finally, compared to kernel partial least squares regression (KPLS), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) models, GMR model showed excellent performance for prediction and generalization. This study demonstrated that FT-NIR spectroscopy analysis technology integrated with appropriate chemometric approaches could be utilized to monitor the growth process of yeast, and GMR revealed its superiority in model calibration.},

  abstract = {Recently, deep learning methods, for example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved high performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The limited training samples of HSI images make it hard to use deep learning methods with many layers and a large number of convolutional kernels as in large scale imagery tasks, and CNN-based methods usually need long training time. In this paper, we present a wide sliding window and subsampling network (WSWS Net) for HSI classification. It is based on layers of transform kernels with sliding windows and subsampling (WSWS). It can be extended in the wide direction to learn both spatial and spectral features more efficiently. The learned features are subsampled to reduce computational loads and to reduce memorization. Thus, layers of WSWS can learn higher level spatial and spectral features efficiently, and the proposed network can be trained easily by only computing linear weights with least squares. The experimental results show that the WSWS Net achieves excellent performance with different hyperspectral remotes sensing datasets compared with other shallow and deep learning methods. The effects of ratio of training samples, the sizes of image patches, and the visualization of features in WSWS layers are presented.},
